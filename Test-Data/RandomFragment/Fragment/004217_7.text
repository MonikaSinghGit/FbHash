CHANDRA PLOUGHS UP A SNAKE IN HYDRA A

     NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the Hydra A galaxy 
cluster has revealed a possible solution to a Herculean puzzle 
about the fate of the largest objects in the universe.

     For years astronomers have been searching unsuccessfully for 
large quantities of matter they believed must be flowing into the 
central regions of galaxy clusters.  The Chandra image of Hydra A 
displays for the first time long snake-like strands of 35 million 
degree gas extending away from the center of the cluster.  These 
structures show that the inflow of cooling gas is deflected by 
magnetic fields produced by explosions from a central black hole.

     The X-ray image also reveals a bright wedge (shown in white) 
of hot multimillion degree gas pushing into the heart of the 
cluster.  Like the legendary Hercules, who had to contend with the 
multiple heads of the monstrous Hydra, astrophysicists now know 
they must deal with the effects of magnetic fields, star 
formation, rotation and black holes if they are to understand what 
is happening in the inner regions of the galaxy cluster.

     As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe, 
galaxy clusters provide crucial clues for understanding the origin 
and fate of the universe.  Each large ous" problem of cosmic significance.

     The Chandra image was taken with the Advanced CCD Imaging 
Spectrometer (ACIS) on October 30, 1999, in an observation that 
lasted about six hours.
