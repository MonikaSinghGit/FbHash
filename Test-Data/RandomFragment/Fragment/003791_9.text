eview was accomplished through
     discussions with responsible managers, reviews of directives and records, attendance at
scheduled
     field meetings, observation of work practices in the field, and interviews with managers,
     supervisors, engineers, and operators.  The following summarizes the major observations from
     the visit.

  a. Except for the Facility Representative (FR) program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H
     in implementing conduct of operations and an effective training and qualification program.
     Progress in the training area appears to be hindered by a lack of senior DOE-AAO
     management attention, compounded by a lack of cooperation between the DOE Albuquerque
     Operations Office (DOE-AL) and DOE-AAO.

  b. M&H has made good progress in formulating a sound training and qualification program. 
     Not all of the elements of this program have been formalized, however, and for those
     formalized and implemented, there are decided differences in the quality of program
     implementation between divisions.  An effective self-assessment system is not fully-
     implemented and a fundamentals training program has only been conceptualized.  A system
     that effectively tracks the qualification and training status of each M&H individual has been
     developed.

  c. Many procedures and directives have been developed to assist in implementing conduct of
     operations principles and to satisfy the requirements of the Pantex Plant Conduct of
     Operations Action Plan (COOAP).  Although progress has been made, the effectiveness of
     the implementation is uneven across the site.  Currently, the program appears to emphasize
     satisfying the near-term COOAP requirements rather than generating a true understanding of
     conduct of operations principles in managers, supervisors, and operators and ensuring
     continued long-term improvement in the formality of operations at Pantex. 
     
3.   Background: Staff reviews in 1993 resulted in formal Board reporting requirements on
training
     and qualification, forwarded July 6, 1993, and conduct of operations, forwarded November 4,
     1993.  The DOE responses to the Board's letters included corrective action plans to address
the
     deficiencies with the programs.  This review was a follow-up to assess the progress made in
     implementing DOE Order 5480.19, Conduct of Operations Requirements for DOE Facilities
and
     DOE Order 5480.20A, Personnel Selection, Qualification, and Training Requirements for
DOE
     Nuclear Facilities.

4.   Discussion: 

  a. DOE-AAO Training and Staffing

     1.   Except for the FR program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H in  implementing a
          sound training and qualification program.  DOE-AAO did not demonstrate that training
          and qualification of their personnel was a top priority receiving constant management
          attention nor did they demonstrate a full understanding of the immense benefit that could
          be derived from a high-caliber training and qualification program.  The following issues
          illustrate the status of the DOE-AAO program:

       (a)               The training and qualification program appeared relatively ineffective based on
the 
                         results of level of knowledge interviews conducted on six DOE-AAO technical
                         personnel.  For example, several DOE-AAO personnel could not adequately
explain
                         general radiological controls, the characteristics of tritium, safety analysis reports,
or
                         the hazards associated with a particular operation.
 
       (b)               A DOE-AAO procedure (102.1.0) governing qualification and training became
                         effective April 15, 1995.  Most of its provisions have not been implemented and
plans
                         for the complete implementation have not been formalized.
  
       (c)               DOE-AAO has obtained copies of all of the draft Recommendation 93-3
Functional
                         Area Qualification Standards and has also reportedly performed a job task
analysis 
                         for all DOE-AAO federal employees.  However, DOE-AAO is not using the
DOE-
                         Human Resources (HR) qualification program.  DOE-AAO intends to address
the
                         program requirement to develop Site Specific Functional Area Qualification
Standards
                         by creating just three such standards. 

       (d)               DOE-AAO has developed Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for all federal
                         employees, as required.  However, it was reported that these were developed by
(in
                         various cases) the associated Assistant Manager, the associated (division) training
                         coordinator, or the first line supervisor, as opposed to being a combined effort of
the
                         employee in question and his first line supervisor as described in DOE Order
3410.1A,
                         Training, and section 5.6 and Appendix F of the mandatory interim guidance in
                         Professional Development of Federal Technical Personnel.  It was also apparent
that
                         IDPs were not being used to determine training needs and there was no
coordinated
                         effort to plan, identify, or obtain needed training at DOE-AAO.  During the staff
                         review, three separate, unconnected efforts to identify training needs were
described.

       (e)               DOE-AL's training division's stated role is to "support DOE-AAO training
goals." 
                         Given the state of DOE-AAO training presented above and several obvious
                         communications problems regarding IDPs, Recommendation 93-3 activities, and
                         requested training approval, greatly improved cooperation will be required by
DOE-
                         AAO and DOE-AL to build a program that supports the DOE-AAO manager's
                         training needs and his vision for the DOE-AAO staff.  

     2.   DOE-AAO has made progress in the FR Program.  A process for recruiting candidates
          is in place and a training and qualification program has been implemented.  Several FRs
          were recently qualified and assigned to facilities.  Further enhancements to their training
          and qualification program to ensure full compliance with DOE Orders 5480.19 and DOE
          Standard 1063, Establishing and Maintaining a Facility Representative Program at DOE
          Nuclear Facilities, are in early stages of formulation. A daily DOE-AAO FR morning
          conference call meeting was attended.  This meeting provided for an interchange of
          important, operationally-related information that has occurred since the last meeting
          between FRs and DOE-AAO management.  It was an interactive meeting and indicative
          of an effort to oversee M&H actions.  During the review it was clear that the inability to
          upgrade the technical competence of the rest of the DOE-AAO technical staff has placed
          a significant technical burden on the FRs. 
 
     3.   DOE-AAO has pursued upgrading the level of technical expertise of the staff through the
          hiring process and an increase in the authorized personnel ceiling from eighty-six to
          ninety-six has been approved.  Although the total number of people on the staff has only
          increased by one over the last three years, the mix has changed significantly, with a large
          increase in the number of people with technical backgrounds.  Despite DOE-AAO's
          recruiting efforts, it has been difficult to attract quality candidates to fill the positions. 
          Even with the issuance of the DOE-HR manual Manager's Guide to Administrative
