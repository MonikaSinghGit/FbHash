8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 23 - 29 2007:

THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION PATTERN EXPECTED IN THE 
8 TO 14 DAY PERIOD.  A TROUGH IS EXPECTED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WITH A RIDGE 
OVER WESTERN PORTIONS OF NORTH AMERICA.  BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED IN 
THE WEST.  WITH THE PACIFIC JET DEFLECTED NORTHWARD OVER THE WESTERN RIDGE... 
BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY... 
EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS OF THE ALASKAN SOUTH COAST AND THE PANHANDLE WHERE THE 
PACIFIC STORM TRACK SHOULD FAVOR WET CONDITIONS... AND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST 
EXTENDING INTO THE GREAT LAKES WHICH WILL BE NEAR OR AHEAD OF THE EASTERN 
TROUGH.  THE RIDGE BUILDS INTO EASTERN ALASKA WITHIN THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD... SO 
TEMPERATURES IN EASTERN ALASKA AND THE PANHANDLE SHOULD MODERATE CONSIDERABLY 
BETWEEN THE 6 TO 10 AND 8 TO 14 DAY PERIOD. 

THE OFFICIAL 8-14 DAY HEIGHT PROG CONSISTS OF 10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 
0Z GFS CENTERED ON DAY 11...10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 6Z GFS CENTERED 
ON DAY 11...20 PERCENT OF TODAY'S 0Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11...20 
PERCENT OF TODAY'S 6Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11...AND 40 PERCENT OF 
TODAY'S GFS SUPERENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD IS ABOVE AVERAGE... 4 ON A SCALE OF 
1 TO 5.

THE 8-14 DAY TEMPERATURE PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC
