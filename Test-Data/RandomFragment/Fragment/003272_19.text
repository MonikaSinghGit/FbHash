er" than thedue process right to be present, as the court of appeals held (App.,infra, 9a), the court nonetheless erred in finding a violation of Rule43 here.  /18/ Not only was there no substantial prejudice torespondents' rights, but, we submit, the trial court would have beenfully justified in denying a request by respondents to attend theconference, had it been made.   b. Even assuming that respondents would have had a right, uponrequest, to attend the juror conference, there remains the questionwhether their failure to assert that right constituted a waiver.  Thecourt of appeals' answer to that question conflicts with decisions ofthis Court and other courts of appeals and with the terms of Rule 43.   The court of appeals held (App., infra, 11a) that the standard forwaiver of the right to be present is that enunciated in Johnson v.Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938) ("intentional relinquishment orabandonment of a known right or privilege").  Since there was noevidence in the record directly establishing that respondents had madea conscious, informed decision to absent themselves from the jurorconference, the court of appeals could not "conclude that theyknowingly and intelligently waived their constitutional right to bepresent" (App., infra, 11a).   We note initially that this analysis depends for its validity onthe premise, shown to be erroneous in the preceding discussion, thatany right the respondents had to attend the conference wasconstitutionally based.  But even were that premise correct, the wrongwaiver standard was employed by the court of appeals.  Indeed, itsholding is in direct conflict with Taylor v. United States, 414 U.S.17, 19-20 (1973).  There, the Court held that the Johnson v. Zerbststandard is inapplicable to a defendant's waiver of the right to bepresent at trial, even for portions as critical as the taking ofevidence.  The voluntary absence of the defendant from the proceeding,without more, constitutes a valid waiver.   There are sound reasons not to apply the Johnson v. Zerbst standa
