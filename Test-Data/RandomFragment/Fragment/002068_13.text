                   BackRround

                   A Board of Schools of Radiation Therapy Technology, American Medical
                   Association Council of Medical Education was established December 1,
                   1968.  Applicants for admission to approved schools must be
                   graduates of approved schools of radiology technology, RNs with a
                   course in radiation physics or such equivalent that is acceptable

                 to the American Registry of Radiology Technology.  Minimum training
                 required is 12 mo nths.  There are approximately 6 approved schools with
                 6 others pending action.

                 Other Federal     ort

                 The Cancer Control Program, Division of Chronic Diseases, has
                 supported ten training programs in radiation therapy technology
                 for about three years.  Beginning in FY 1968, funding authority
                 for these grants was transferred to Comprehensive Health Planning
                 Program of Cor@miunity Health Service, under the authority of
                 Section 314(3) of the Public Health Servi-ce-Act.  As in the case
                 of cytotechnology training, there will be no allocation of funds
                 for these projects beyond the end of FY 1969.

            Recommendation

            DRMP staff recommends the following criteria be considered by National
            Advisory Council regarding DRMP support of basic training in established
            allied health professions.  A health profession will be considered
            established if a Board of Schools, American Medical Association Council
            on Medical Education, has been set up to approve schools, define standards
            for admission, curriculum requirements and certification procedures.

                    Relevance of the training activity to regional medical
                    programs, i. e. categorical  and public health relevance.
                    Training in nuclear medicine technology, radiation therapy
                    technology and inhalation therapy would thus have greater
                    significance for regional medical programs than training
                    of medical records librarians or orthopedic assistants,
                    for example.

                    Number of training opportunities available to meet
                    training needs.  In the case of cytotechnblogy training
                    the current number of training programs is.believed to
                    be adequate to meet the needs.  This is not so in some
                    areas of the country for inhalation therapy,and in most areas
                    of the country for nuclear medicine and radiation therapy
                    technology training.

            The above criteria are to be used in addition to, not as a substitute
            for, those outlined by the National Advisory Council for basic training
            of Allied Health professions.  (See NID, May 13, 1969, p.4)

            Alsoi as stated previously, regions are encouraged to use professional
            staff assistance and support of special planning studies to provide
            new educational and training opportunities in new and established allied
            health professions when
