                           The Division staff offers the following background.

                   Bac

                   Upon recommendation of the National Advisory Council, the Division
                   identified cytotechnology as-an established allied health discipline
                   which would not be eligible for IQ.4P funds according to the
                   criteria adopted by  Council  regarding  support  of  basic  training
                   of established allied health professions.

                   The Division  now  suggests  that  Council  consider  other  established
                   allied health  disciplines  such  as  inhalation  therapy,  nuclear
                   medicine technology and radiation therapy technology.

                   TRAINING OF INHALATION THERAPY

                   The Board of Schools of Inhalation    Therapy  was  organized  under
                   the Council on Medical  Education  and  Hospitals  of  the  American
                   Medical  Association  in  1962.  Minimal  standards  for  inhalation
                   therapy were established by the American Association of Inhalation
             nt; Interior and Civil Service
                 Commission to identify manpower problems in an area, delineate
                 resources and develop linkages between pro@rams.

                 Division staff recommends that regions be given information
                 concerning CAYLPS so that manpower programs car, be coordinated
                 with them.  Upon request, the Department of Labor has agreed to
