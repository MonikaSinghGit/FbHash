DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD

                                   May 23, 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR:     G.W. Cunningham, Technical Director

COPIES:             Board Members

FROM:               Matthew B. Moury, Pantex Program Manager

SUBJECT:            Pantex Site - DNFSB Staff  Report - Conduct of Operations and
                    Training and Qualification Program Review.


1.   Purpose:  This memorandum documents the results of a review of conduct of operations and
     training and qualification programs at Pantex.  Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (Board)
     staff members J. DeLoach, T. Dwyer, M. Moury, and H. Waugh, and outside expert 
  D. Volgenau conducted the review during the period April 19-21, 1995.  Board Member Mr.
  J.W. Crawford, Jr. participated on one day of the review.

2.   Summary:   The training and qualification  programs and the implementation of conduct of
     operations at Mason and Hanger-Silas Mason Company (M&H) and the Department of
Energy
     (DOE) Amarillo Area Office (AAO) were reviewed.  This review was accomplished through
     discussions with responsible managers, reviews of directives and records, attendance at
scheduled
     field meetings, observation of work practices in the field, and interviews with managers,
     supervisors, engineers, and operators.  The following summarizes the major observations from
     the visit.

  a. Except for the Facility Representative (FR) program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H
     in implementing conduct of operations and an effective training and qualification program.
     Progress in the training area appears to be hindered by a lack of senior DOE-AAO
     management attention, compounded by a lack of cooperation between the DOE Albuquerque
     Operations Office (DOE-AL) and DOE-AAO.

  b. M&H has made good progress in formulating a sound trai   
     3.   The M&H Drill Program was reviewed.  Only three drill sets have been run thus far in
          1995; all three were very simplistic.  The Drill Schedule for the remainder of 1995
          averages only four drill sets per quarter over all of the Manufacturing Division.
   
 5.  Follow-up Activities:  The Board's staff will continue to follow conduct of operations and
     training and qualification program implementation as part of normal staff reviews of Pantex
     activities.
