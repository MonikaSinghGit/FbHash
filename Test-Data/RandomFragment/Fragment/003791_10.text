 DOE-AAO personnel could not adequately
explain
                         general radiological controls, the characteristics of tritium, safety analysis reports,
or
                         the hazards associated with a particular operation.
 
       (b)               A DOE-AAO procedure (102.1.0) governing qualification and training became
                         effective April 15, 1995.  Most of its provisions have not been implemented and
plans
                         for the complete implementation have not been formalized.
  
       (c)               DOE-AAO has obtained copies of all of the draft Recommendation 93-3
Functional
                         Area Qualification Standards and has also reportedly performed a job task
analysis 
                         for all DOE-AAO federal employees.  However, DOE-AAO is not using the
DOE-
                         Human Resources (HR) qualification program.  DOE-AAO intends to address
the
                         program requirement to develop Site Specific Functional Area Qualification
Standards
                         by creating just three such standards. 

       (d)               DOE-AAO has developed Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for all federal
                         employees, as required.  However, it was reported that these were developed by
(in
                         various cases) the associated Assistant Manager, the associated (division) training
                         coordinator, or the first line supervisor, as opposed to being a combined effort of
the
                         employee in question and his first line supervisor as described in DOE Order
3410.1A,
                         Training, and section 5.6 and Appendix F of the mandatory interim guidance in
                         Professional Development of Federal Technical Personnel.  It was also apparent
that
                         IDPs were not being used to determine training needs and there was no
coordinated
                         effort to plan, identify, or obtain needed training at DOE-AAO.  During the staff
                         review, three separate, unconnected efforts to identify training needs were
described.

       (e)               DOE-AL's training division's stated role is to "support DOE-AAO training
goals." 
                         Given the state of DOE-AAO training presented above and several obvious
                         communications problems regarding IDPs, Recommendation 93-3 activities, and
                         requested training approval, greatly improved cooperation will be required by
DOE-
                         AAO and DOE-AL to build a program that supports the DOE-AAO manager's
                         training needs and his vision for the DOE-AAO staff.  

     2.   DOE-AAO has made progress in the FR Program.  A process for recruiting candidates
          is in place and a training and qualification program has been implemented.  Several FRs
          were recently qualified and assigned to facilities.  Further enhancements to their training
          and qualification program to ensure full compliance with DOE Orders 5480.19 and DOE
          Standard 1063, Establishing and Maintaining a Facility Representative Program at DOE
          Nuclear Facilities, are in early stages of formulation. A daily DOE-AAO FR morning
          conference call meeting was attended.  This meeting provided for an interchange of
          important, operationally-related information that has occurred since the last meeting
          between FRs and DOE-AAO management.  It was an interactive meeting and indicative
          of an effort to oversee M&H actions.  During the review it was clear that the inability to
          upgrade the technical competence of the rest of the DOE-AAO technical staff has placed
          a significant technical burden on the FRs. 
 
     3.   DOE-AAO has pursued upgrading the level of technical expertise of the staff through the
          hiring process and an increase in the authorized personnel ceiling from eighty-six to
          ninety-six has been approved.  Although the total number of people on the staff has only
          increased by one over the last three years, the mix has changed significantly, with a large
          increase in the number of people with technical backgrounds.  Despite DOE-AAO's
          recruiting efforts, it has been difficult to attract quality candidates to fill the positions. 
          Even with the issuance of the DOE-HR manual Manager's Guide to Administrative
          Flexibilities, DOE-AAO reported difficulty obtaining travel pay, hiring bonuses, "double-
          dipping" approvals, excepted service authority, and upper steps authorizations for GS pay
          grades.  For example, DOE-AAO submitted a request for one excepted service position. 
          The initial request was rejected (documentation inadequacies); the resubmittal required
          six weeks for approval.  Due to the urgency of the need for an individual in the position,
          DOE-AAO was forced to fill the billet using the standard personnel system.  

  b. Mason & Hanger Training and Qualification Program

     M&H has made progress in formulating a sound training and qualification program; however,
     not all of the elements of this program have been formalized or implemented.  For example,
     the production supervisors have not received additional technical training, as required by
     DOE Order 5480.20A,  above that required for production technicians .  For those elements
     of the program that have been implemented, there are decided differences in the quality of the
     program between divisions.  In addition, an effective self-assessment program is not in place. 
     A fundamentals training program is planned, but has not been formulated.  M&H training
     records and the Training Records and Certification System (TRAC) program appeared to be
     very effectively managed and used.

  c. Conduct of Operations

     1.   The COOAP was developed from the recommendations made by the independent conduct
          of operations assessments performed in January and November 1994.  The focus to date
          by DOE and M&H appears to be on completion of the administrative issues addressed in
          the COOAP with limited assessment of actual operational improvement in the facilities. 
          No DOE plans to ensure continued improvement in the conduct of operations at Pantex,
          beyond the completion of actions required by the COOAP, were evident.  Following the
          staff review, DOE-HQ stated a plan was being developed to address this deficiency;
          however, the plan is currently conceptual.  Adherence to the tenets of conduct of
          operations and continuous improvement in the formality of operations will require focused
          management attention.  The following specific examples of adherence issues and a lack
          of attention to detail were identified during Board staff observation of weapons and
          maintenance operations:
     
       (a)               Production technicians performed procedural steps in a for
