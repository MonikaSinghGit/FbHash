NASA will hold the first Space Station Freedom Utilization Conference
next week in Huntsville.  The purpose of the conference, set for Monday
through Thursday, August 3 through 6, is to inform potential
researchers about Freedom capabilities, plans and opportunities for
research and to provide an open forum for exchange of information and
ideas between space station managers and potential space station
investigators.  As part of the forum, experienced researchers who have
flown equipment aboard Spacelab will describe their experiences and
learned lessons.  Further information on the conference can be obtained
from Barry Epst
