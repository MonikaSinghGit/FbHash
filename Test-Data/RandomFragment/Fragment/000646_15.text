Bayesian BUGS 2-Lab Consensus Mean
Mark Levenson Analysis
Bayesian Posterior Distribution Values
   from a Normal(.32,.02) Prior Distribution
Note--These calibration values
      were computed from BUGS by Blaza Toman (9/01)
Number of observations = 1000
Number of variables = 1
Order of variables on a line image--
   1. Response = Mercury mass fraction
The 1000 observations should have the following statistics:
     mean        sd       2.5%CI     97.5%CI    median
   3.261E-1   1.629E-2   .2919E-1   3.554E-1   3.277E-1
