MEMORANDUM FOR:     G.W. Cunningham, Technical Director

COPIES:             Board Members

FROM:               Matthew B. Moury, Pantex Program Manager

SUBJECT:            Pantex Site - DNFSB Staff  Report - Conduct of Operations and
                    Training and Qualification Program Review.


1.   Purpose:  This memorandum documents the results of a review of conduct of operations and
     training and qualification programs at Pantex.  Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (Board)
     staff members J. DeLoach, T. Dwyer, M. Moury, and H. Waugh, and outside expert 
  D. Volgenau conducted the review during the period April 19-21, 1995.  Board Member Mr.
  J.W. Crawford, Jr. participated on one day of the review.

2.   Summary:   The training and qualification  programs and the implementation of conduct of
     operations at Mason and Hanger-Silas Mason Company (M&H) and the Department of
Energy
     (DOE) Amarillo Area Office (AAO) were reviewed.  This review was accomplished through
     discussions with responsible managers, reviews of directives and records, attendance at
scheduled
     field meetings, observation of work practices in the field, and interviews with managers,
     supervisors, engineers, and operators.  The following summarizes the major observations from
     the visit.

  a. Except for the Facility Representative (FR) program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H
     in implementing conduct of operations and an effective training and qualification program.
     Progress in the training area appears to be hindered by a lack of senior DOE-AAO
     management attention, compounded by a lack of cooperation between the DOE Albuquerque
     Operations Office (DOE-AL) and DOE-AAO.

  b. M&H has made good progress in formulating a sound training and qualification program. 
     Not all of the elements of this program have been formalized, however, and for those
     formalized and implemented, there are decided differences in the quality of program
     implementation between divisions.  An effective self-assessment system is not fully-
     implemented and a fundamentals training program has only been conceptualized.  A system
     that effectively tracks the qualification and training status of each M&H individual has been
     developed.

  c. Many procedures and directives have been developed to assist in implementing conduct of
     operations principles and to satisfy the requirements of the Pantex Plant Conduct of
     Operations Action Plaementation have not been formalized.
  
       (c)               DOE-AAO has obtained copies of all of the draft Recommendation 93-3
Functional
                         Area Qualification Standards and has also reportedly performed a job task
analysis 
                         for all DOE-AAO federal employees.  However, DOE-AAO is not using the
DOE-
                         Human Resources (HR) qualification program.  DOE-AAO intends to address
the
                         program requirement to develop Site Specific Functional Area Qualification
Standards
                         by creating just three such standards. 

       (d)               DOE-AAO has developed Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for all federal
                         employees, as required.  However, it was reported that these were developed by
(in
                         various cases) the associated Assistant Manager, the associated (division) training
                         coordinator, or the first line supervisor, as opposed to being a combined effort of
the
                         employee in question and his first line supervisor as described in DOE Order
3410.1A,
                         Training, and section 5.6 and Appendix F of the mandatory interim guidance in
                         Professional Development of Federal Technical Personnel.  It was also apparent
that
                         IDPs were not being used to determine training needs and there was no
coordinated
                         effort to plan, identify, or obtain needed training at DOE-AAO.  During the staff
                         review, three separate, unconnected efforts to identify training needs were
described.

       (e)               DOE-AL's training division's stated role is to "support DOE-AAO training
goals." 
                         Given the state of DOE-AAO training presented above and several obvious
                         communications problems regarding IDPs, Recommendation 93-3 activities, and
                         requested training approval, greatly improved cooperation will be required by
DOE-
                         AAO and DOE-AL to build a program that supports the DOE-AAO manager's
                         training needs and his vision for the DOE-AAO staff.  

     2.   DOE-AAO has made progress in the FR Program.  A process for recruiting candidates
          is in place and a training and qualification program has been implemented.  Several FRs
          were recently qualified and assigned to facilities.  Further enhancements to their training
          and qualification program to ensure full compliance with DOE Orders 5480.19 and DOE
          Standard 1063, Establishing and Maintaining a Facility Representative Program at DOE
          Nuclear Facilities, are in early stages of formulation. A daily DOE-AAO FR morning
          conference call meeting was attended.  This meeting provided for an interchange of
          important, operationally-related information that has occurred since the last meeting
          between FRs and DOE-AAO management.  It was an interactive meeting and indicative
          of an effort to oversee M&H actions.  During the review it was clear that the inability to
          upgrade the technical competence of the rest of the DOE-AAO technical staff has placed
          a significant technical burden on the FRs. 
 
     3.   DOE-AAO has pursued upgrading the level of technical expertise of the staff through the
          hiring process and an increase in the authorized personnel ceiling from eighty-six to
          ninety-six has been approved.  Although the total number of people on the staff has only
          increased by one over the last three years, the mix has changed significantly, with a large
          increase in the number of people with technical backgrounds.  Despite DOE-AAO's
          recruiting efforts, it has been difficult to attract quality candidates to fill the positions. 
          Even with the issuance of the DOE-HR manual Manager's Guide to Administrative
          Flexibilities, DOE-AAO reported difficulty obtaining travel pay, hiring bonuses, "double-
          dipping" approvals, excepted service authority, and upper steps authorizations for GS pay
          grades.  For example, DOE-AAO submitted a request for one excepted service position. 
          The initial request was rejected (documentation inadequacies); the resubmittal required
          six weeks for approval.  Due to the urgency of the need for an individual in the position,
          DOE-AAO was forced to fill the billet using the standard personnel system.  

  b. Mason & Hanger Training and Qualification Program

     M&H has made progress in formulating a sound training and qualification program; however,
     not all of the elements of this program have been formalized or implemented.  For example,
     the production supervisors have not received additional technical training, as required by
     DOE Order 5480.20A,  above that required for production technicians .  For those elements
     of the program that have been implemented, there are decided differences in the quality of the
     program between divisions.  In addition, an effective self-assessment program is not in place. 
     A fundamentals training program is planned, but has not been formulated.  M&H training
     records and the Training Records and Certification System (TRAC) program appeared to be
     very effectively managed and used.

  c. Conduct of Operations

     1.   The COOAP was developed from the recommendations made by the independent conduct
          of operations assessments performed in January and November 1994.  The focus to date
          by DOE and M&H appears to be on completion of the administrative issues addressed in
          the COOAP with limited assessment of actual operational improvement in the facilities. 
          No DOE plans to ensure continued improvement in the conduct of operations at Pantex,
          beyond the completion of actions required by the COOAP, were evident.  Following the
          staff review, DOE-HQ stated a plan was being developed to address this deficiency;
          however, the plan is currently conceptual.  Adherence to the tenets of conduct of
          operations and continuous improvement in the formality of operations will require focused
          management attention.  The following specific examples of adherence issues and a lack
          of attention to detail were identified during Board staff observation of weapons and
          maintenance operations:
     
       (a)               Production technicians performed procedural steps in a formal, but inconsistent,
                         manner.  The reader did not always observe what the operator was doing after
reading
                         a procedural step.  During the performance of a pre-operational check, one
technician
                         performed a check of a blast door interlock while he was out of sight of the
verifier. 
                         The interlock was verified as satisfactory by the technician who did not observe
its
                         operation.
  
       (b)               The Radiological Work Permit (RWP) next to a bay entrance was not completed
                         according to the DOE Radiological Control Manual.  The sign-off sheet did not
                         contain either the RWP or revision number.  The RWP stated that alpha, beta,
gamma
                         and neutron radiation was expected, yet the estimated maximum exposure portion
of
                         the RWP was marked as not applicable.  The estimated removable contamination
                         levels were stated as greater than a high value, while the latest weekly area survey
                         showed all areas surveyed to be a factor of ten less than this.  The area survey
had not
                         been signed by a supervisor as required by the form.

       (c)               The General Instructions section of a maintenance procedure includes the
following
                         statement:  "Action steps in Section 5 TASK INSTRUCTIONS are for guidance
                         and are NOT intended to be performed step by step."  Two maintenance
                         technicians who were very familiar with these maintenance procedures, therefore,
                         did not follow step-by-step, resulting in several minor supporting requirements
                         being missed (e.g., public address announcements when system taken out of
                         service, etc.).

       (d)               The process of transferring a facility to various modes for maintenance, repair,
and
                         operations has been formalized; however, many flaws in the process were
observed. 
                         For example, no system post-maintenance testing was specified or performed,
                         although the four different critical safety systems were manipulated and the pre-
                         operational checklists may be performed again following maintenance at the
discretion
                         of the facility manager.

       (e)               Material deficiencies with the fire suppression system (valve stem packing leaks)
were
                         observed but not documented by the fire department technicians operating the
system. 
                         No deficiency tag existed as required by local procedures. Upon questioning, the
                         technicians stated that such items are normally reported verbally to their
supervisor.

     2.   The Manufacturing Division has recently (February 1995) effected an organizational
          restructuring designed to improve the weapons assembly and disassembly operations by
          clearly delineating the roles of the division operations, facility, and program managers.
          Although briefings on this restructuring have been given to individuals in the division, the
          details of the restructuring have not been formally promulgated.  Meanwhile, the
          certification process for weapons evolutions and actual weapons operations continue. 
          The lack of formal promulgation of this restructuring is not in keeping with the
          requirements placed on managers, supervisors, and operators by DOE Order 5480.19.
       
     3.   The M&H Drill Program was reviewed.  Only three drill sets have been run thus far in
          1995; all three were very simplistic.  The Drill Schedule for the remainder of 1995
          averages only four drill sets per quarter over all of the Manufacturing Division.
   
 5.  Follow-up Activities:  The Board's staff will continue to follow conduct of operations and
     training and qualification program implementation as part of normal staff reviews of Pantex
     activities.
