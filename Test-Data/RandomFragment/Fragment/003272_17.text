e how the court of appeals could haveconcluded that there was a miscarriage of justice here, had it engagedin an appropriate "plain error" analysis.  As noted, the presence ofrespondents at the juror interview would have been useless or worsethan useless.  The court of appeals' own suggestion as to prejudice,as has been shown, was fanciful.  And finally, the underlying issue --the impartiality of the jurors who observed respondent Gagnonsketching -- was resolved by the trial court, on the basis of aninterview with the principal juror in question.  The question of jurorimpartiality is heavily dependent on the trial court's assessment ofthe sincerity of the juror's answers.  There is nothing in the recordthat would justify an appellate court in overturning the trial court'sconclusion that the jury panel would not be tainted by the sketchingincident.  See Rushen v. Spain, slip op. 6.  This is especially truesince defense counsel expressly agreed with the trial court's decisionat trial.   Many courts of appeals, in factual circumstances similar to orworse than these, have concluded that there was no prejudice to thedefendant from a denial of his right to be present at every stage oftrial.  The reasoning, as well as the result, of these decisions is indirect conflict with the decision below.  /29/ See, e.g., UnitedStates v. Brown, 571 F.2d 980, 987 (6th Cir. 1978) (defendant'sabsence from conference in chambers regarding dismissal of juror wasnot prejudicial given defense counsel's presence and the availabilityof a transcript of the proceeding;  furthermore, the issue was waivedby failure to object);  Henderson v. Lane, 613 F.2d 175, 179 (7thCir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 986 (1980) (defendant's absence fromexamination of alternate jurors was harmless because counsel waspresent, proceeding was on the record, and defendant had been presentduring original jury selection);  United States v. Washington, 705F.2d 489, 498 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (defendant's absence from colloquy atbench with potential jurors was harmless because counsel was presentand took notes);  Nevels v. Parratt, 596 F.2d 344 (8th Cir. 1979)(defendant's absence from conference with juror concerning possiblemisconduct was harmless;  defense counsel participated in conference,no request for defendant to attend was made, and State had shown thatjuror in question remained impartial);  /30/ see also United States v.Walls, 577 F.2d 690, 697-699 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 893(1978) (defendant's absence from conference with juror harmlessbecause counsel was present, the conference was on record, and noobjection was raised).  The decision below conflicts even morestrikingly with decisions finding the absence of the defendant from astage of the proceeding harmless even though defense counsel was notpresent.  E.g., United States v. Yonn, 702 F.2d 1341, 1344-1345 (11thCir. 1983);  United States v. Dominguez, 615 F.2d 1093, 1094-1096 (5thCir. 1980);  United States v. Bufalino, 576 F.2d 446, 451 (2d Cir.),cert. denied, 439 U.S. 928 (1978).   The conclusion is inescapable that the convictions in this case forserious crimes involving hundreds of thousands of dollars in wholesalenarcotics trafficking were needlessly reversed.  Moreover, it isapparent that many future convictions could suffer the same fate underthe court of appeals' tortured understanding of the right to bepresent at trial and the defendant's lack of any obligation to assertthat right at a time when it could be accommodated.  This Courtrecently summarily reversed a Ninth Circuit decision that opened thegate to reversals on the basis of the right to be present, withoutregard to whether the supposed violations were prejudicial to thedefense.  Rushen v. Spain, supra.  The instant decision, from the samecourt of appeals, is in a similar vein, but with potentially morefar-reaching consequences.  /31/   It was in precisely the same context of a supposed infringement onthe right to be present that this Court stated in Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U.S. at 122:      There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into      contempt -- that discredit will even touch the great immunities      assured by the Fourteenth Amendment -- if gossamer possibilities      of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence pronounced      by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience to * * * law,      and set the guilty free.
