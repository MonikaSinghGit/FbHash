                   of established allied health professions.

                   The Division  now  suggests  that  Council  consider  other  established
                   allied health  disciplines  such  as  inhalation  therapy,  nuclear
                   medicine technology and radiation therapy technology.

                   TRAINING OF INHALATION THERAPY

                   The Board of Schools of Inhalation    Therapy  was  organized  under
                   the Council on Medical  Education  and  Hospitals  of  the  American
                   Medical  Association  in  1962.  Minimal  standards  for  inhalation
                   therapy were established by the American Association of Inhalation
                   Therapy, the American  College  of  Chest  Physicians  and  the
                   American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists.  Graduates  are   certified
                   for practice by  the  American  Registry  of  Inhalation  Therapists.
                   To date, there  are  56  approved  schools.  Approval  by  the  American
                   Medical Association Board of  Schools  requires  a  minimum  of  18
                   months or 2 academic years of training.

                   2.. The U.S. Department  of  Labor  has  supported  some  inhalation
                   therapy training under  New  Careers  and  under  the  Manpower
                   Development and Training Act but  it  has  been  minimal,  i.e.,  in
                   fiscal year  1968,  Manpower  Development  and  Training  Act  supported
                   81 trainee positions in inhalation therapy.
                   3.. The Office of  Vocational  Edi-ication  supported  three  inhalation
                  ,therapy programs and 38  students  in  1966.  In  1968,  the  number  of
                   programs increased to  approximately  30  and  the  number  of  students
                   to 353.
