Subject: Re: soil carbon error

Dear Gail Chmura:

Thank you for your interest in my paper.  You are correct - this is really
a pasture, not the first stages of a woodland.  I classified the plots
based on Holdridge life-zones and this one is cool temperate wet forest
based on climate and so it inadvertantly got left on the wrong table. I
waivered about putting this one in because of the initial conditions (same
from the mine soil bank plots) and was suprised to see how much C
accumulated.

There is another mistake in this table as well so if you are going through
the table you may be perplexed by this as well.  I attach below a reply to
another keen observer of our calculations.  I guess I need to construct an
errata page.

I would be interested in hearing more about the manuscript you are
preparing.
