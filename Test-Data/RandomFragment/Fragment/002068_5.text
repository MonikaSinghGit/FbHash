                           Technology.,

                           The Division staff offers the following background.

                   Bac

                   Upon recommendation of the National Advisory Council, the Division
                   identified cytotechnology as-an established allied health discipline
                   which would not be eligible for IQ.4P funds according to the
                   criteria adopted by  Council  regarding  support  of  basic  training
                   of established allied health professions.

                   The Division  now  suggests  that  Council  consider  other  established
                   allied health  disciplines  such  as  inhalation  therapy,  nuclear
                   medicine technology and radiation therapy technology.

                   TRAINING OF INHALATION THERAPY

                   The Board of Schools of Inhalation    Therapy  was  organized  under
                   the Council on Medical  Education  and  Hospitals  of  the  American
                   Medical  Association  in  1962.  Minimal  standards  for  inhalation
                   therapy were established by the American Association of Inhalation
                   Therapy, the American  College  of  Chest  Physicians  and  the
                   American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists.  Graduates  are   certified
                   for practice by  the  American  Registry  of  Inhalation  Therapists.
                   To date, there  are  56  approved  schools.  Approval  by  the  American
                   Medical Association Board of  Schools  requires  a  minimum  of  18
                   months or 2 academic years of training.


                   Other Federal      ort
                   J.., The Division of Allied Health, Bureau of Health Manpower and
                   'Educational Service, is  currently  (fiscal  year  1969)  supporting
                   seven inhalation therapy  training  programs  in  five  junior  and
                   two senior  colleges  under  their  Basic  Improvement  Grants.
                   2.. The U.S. Department  of  Labor  has  supported  some  inhalation
                   therapy training under  New  Careers  and  under  the  Manpower
                   Development and Training Act but  it  has  been  minimal,  i.e.,  in
                   fiscal year  1968,  Manpower  Development  and  Training  Act  supported
                   81 trainee positions in inhalation therapy.
                   3.. The Office of  Vocational  Edi-ication  supported  three  inhalation
                  ,therapy programs and 38  students  in  1966.  In  1968,  the  number  of
                   programs increased to  approximately  30  and  the  number  of  students
                   to 353.

                A Board of Schools of Nuclear Medicine Technology has just been established,
                July, 1969, as part 6-ic the American Medical Association Council on
                Medical Education to review all educational programs and to set standards
                for practice.  "Essentials of an Acceptable Educational Program in
                Nuclear Medicine Technology" specifies admission and mi.nimu-m training
                requirements for the  -nuclear  medicine  technologist  and  nuclear  medicine
                technician.


                Other Federal Support

                1.  The Bureau of Radiological Health, Environmental- Control Administration,
                    is supporting two pro,-rams in Cincinnati to develop protocols for
                    nuclear medicine training, one at the baccalaureate and the other
                    at the associate degree level.
                2.  The Division of Allied Health, Bureau of Health Professions Education
                    and Manpower Training, is supporting a  4  year  program  at  Un4-vers:lty

                     of Iowa under the Divisioii's Developmental Grants for new Allied
                     Health Professions.  Nuclear medicine technology does not qualify
                     under Basic Improvement (formula) Grants because it is not
                     listed in the legislation as one of the professions eligible
                     for such support.
                 3.  The Office of Education, Bureau of    'Research, Division of
                     Comprehensive  and  Vocational  Education  Research,   is   supporting
                     a  research  project  at  the  Technical  Education  Research  Center,
                     Inc., Waco, Texas entitled Development of     .Career    Opportunities
                     ubstitute
            for, those outlined by the National Advisory Council for basic training
            of Allied Health professions.  (See NID, May 13, 1969, p.4)

            Alsoi as stated previously, regions are encouraged to use professional
            staff assistance and support of special planning studies to provide
            new educational and training opportunities in new and established allied
            health professions when needed.

            General Background Information             ther Feder     )i)ort

            a.   The Allied Health Professions Personnel Training Act provides
                 Basic Improvement (formula) Grants for only those professions
                 specifically listed in the legislation.  Therefore, nuclear
                 medicine technology and others which were not I'sted do not
                                                                1
                 qualify for this support.  They could qualify under the Act's
                 Developmental Grants but funds are severely limited.
             b.  In general, State Department of Education funds are awarded
                 only to educational institutions.  Vocational education funds,
                .therefore, go to vocational-technical area schools, junior and
                 community colleges, technical institutes and four-.year colleges
                 and universities under an approved State plan.  The 1968 Amendments
                 to the Vocational Education Act of 1963 expands the-activities
                 and increases the authorization for State grant programs.  States are
                 now required to spend at least 15% of their basic allotment for
                 the disadvantaged.  The amendments also stress that no less than
                 15% of funds available for State vocational educational programs
                 sball be used for post secondary vocational education.
                 The House of Representatives, U.S. Congress has now voted
                 to increase Federal appropriations to the States to look at
                 their educational- needs and to supply the training to meet those
                 n eeds.  Further increases in the number of allied health training
                 programs should, logically, follow if local areas make their
                 needs known to the State Departments of Education.
             c.  The occupational Training Programs, Manpower Development and
                 Training Act is co-administered by the Department of Labor and
                 HEW and emphasizes training programs for the unemployed and
                 underemployed.  State plans should provide for 2/3 of NDTA basic
                 program enrollees to be disadvantaged individuals.
                 During fiscal year 1970, the Manpower Administration will encourage
                 programs that include training for new occupations to relieve more
                 highly skilled personnel of routine duties, upgrading existing
                 personnel such as nurses aides to LP@ls, training in connection with
                 development of career ladders and training which may assist in
                 reducing turnover.
             d.  There now exists throughout the country Cooperative Area Manpower
                 Planning Systems Committees in each area.  CAMS is an interagency
                 effort with representatives from the Departments of Labor; Health,
                 Education, and Welfare; Office of Economic Opportunity; Agriculture;
                 Commerce; Housing and Urban Development; Interior and Civil Service
                 Commission to identify manpower problems in an area, delineate
                 resources and develop linkages between pro@rams.

                 Division staff recommends that regions be given information
                 concerning CAYLPS so that manpower programs car, be coordinated
                 with them.  Upon request, the Department of Labor has agreed to





                                               -7-



                compile a list of the Chairmen of all of the C@TS committees
                throughout the country which will be made available to the Division.
