BEAN MARKET SUMMARY

BEANS

    Dry Edible Bean market activity has picked up in recent weeks with the most 
active being noted on Pinto and Black beans with the increased demand from Mexico.  
However, this week trading became slow at current price levels, as some participants 
were waiting on the Government purchases to be announced later this week on the 2630 
MT of pinto beans. There is concern in the Great Northern market due very light 
demand for heavy supply. Uncertainty, among buyers and sellers has been caused the 
unsettled market conditions.   However, as more classes are starting be posted at 
the grower levels, markets began to establish.   All prices quoted are quoted on 
very limited trading.  PINTOS were generally steady, a firm undertone in ND on the 
dealer level; grower levels steady.  GREAT NORTHERNS were not established at either 
the dealer or grower level in all regions due to no demand for heavy offerings.  
SMALL WHITES were not established at either the dealer or grower level.  LIGHT RED 
KIDNEYS dealer levels steady in very limited trading; not established at grower 
levels.  DARK RED KIDNEYS were not established at either theding activity was slow.   Demand light to moderate.  All 
classes were steady on limited grower selling.  The lack of moisture either in the 
form of rain or snow has many growers concerned and causing them to be hesitant to 
commit.
