PEAS AND LENTILS MARKET SUMMARY

    DEALER MARKET:  Trading activity was light to moderate.  ID Peas and Lentil 
prices were steady to firm; ND Green peas had no recent test to compare.  Business 
was slowed due to the most recent government invitation which awards will be 
announced later this week.  The invitation accounts for about 18, 020 MT of peas and 
lentils. Yellow splits, wholes and Green whole peas make up the majority of the 
tonnage.

    GROWER MARKET:     Market activity moderate.  Green and Yellow Peas levels are 
steady.  Pardina and Brewer lentils were steady.  ND grower prices started coming 
back on the board this week as growers were looking at the recent government 
invention that is due tomorrow.  Up to this point the only movement being noted out 
of ND was shipments to fill Government contracts that were issued late last year.

CALIFORNIA BEAN MARKET SUMMARY

    DEALER MARKET:  Trading activity was slow.   Demand light.  All classes traded 
at mostly steady prices with limited movement.
    GROWER MARKET:  Trading activity was slow.   Demand light to moderate.  All 
classes were steady on limited grower selling.  The lack of moisture either in the 
form of rain or snow has many growers concerned and causing them to be hesitant to 
commit.
