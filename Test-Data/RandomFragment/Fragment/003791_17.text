     very effectively managed and used.

  c. Conduct of Operations

     1.   The COOAP was developed from the recommendations made by the independent conduct
          of operations assessments performed in January and November 1994.  The focus to date
          by DOE and M&H appears to be on completion of the administrative issues addressed in
          the COOAP with limited assessment of actual operational improvement in the facilities. 
          No DOE plans to ensure continued improvement in the conduct of operations at Pantex,
          beyond the completion of actions required by the COOAP, were evident.  Following the
          staff review, DOE-HQ stated a plan was being developed to address this deficiency;
          however, the plan is currently conceptual.  Adherence to the tenets of conduct of
          operations and continuous improvement in the formality of operations will require focused
          management attention.  The following specific examples of adherence issues and a lack
          of attention to detail were identified during Board staff observation of weapons and
          maintenance operations:
     
       (a)               Production technicians performed procedural steps in a formal, but inconsistent,
                         manner.  The reader did not always observe what the operator was doing after
reading
                         a procedural step.  During the performance of a pre-operational check, one
technician
                         performed a check of a blast door interlock while he was
