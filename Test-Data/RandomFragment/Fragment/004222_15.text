ND 7 MAY BRING ENOUGH PRECIPITATION EARLY IN 
THE PERIOD TO MAKE THE 5-DAY TOTAL ABOVE MEDIAN.  BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED FOR MOST OF ALASKA UNDER THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH... ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
CONFLICTING INDICATIONS AMONG THE TOOLS.  WET CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE 
ALASKAN PANHANDLE AS THE MAIN PACIFIC STORM TRACK IS DEFLECTED NORTHWARD INTO 
THE REGION OVER THE BUILDING RIDGE OVER WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.  

TODAYS OFFICIAL 500-HPA BLEND CONSISTS OF 10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 0Z 
GFS CENTERED ON DAY 8...10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 6Z GFS CENTERED ON 
DAY 8...50 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL ECMWF CENTERED ON DAY 7...AND 30 
PERCENT OF TODAY'S GFS SUPERENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 8.

MODEL(S) OF THE DAY: 0Z ECMWF ENSEMBLE MEAN. 

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD IS BELOW AVERAGE... 2 ON A SCALE OF 
1 TO 5... DUE TO AN EXPECTED TRANSITION IN UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION REGIMES 
WITHIN THE PERIOD.

THE 6-10 DAY TEMPERATURE PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
REFORECAST TEMPERATURE TOOL...  ANALOGS FROM THE VARIOUS MODELS... AND THE 
NORTH AMERICAN ENSEMBLE FORECAST SYSTEM TEMPERATURE OUTLOOK.  

THE 6-10 DAY PRECIPITATION PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
PRECIPITATION TOOL...  ANALOG AND NEURAL NET SPECIFICATIONS FROM THE OFFICIAL 
BLENDED HEIGHT FIELD

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 23 - 29 2007:

THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION PATTERN EXPECTED IN THE 
8 TO 14 DAY PERIOD.  A TROUGH IS EXPECTED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WITH A RIDGE 
OVER WESTERN PORTIONS OF NORTH AMERICA.  BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED IN 
THE WEST.  WITH THE PACIFIC JET DEFLECTED NORTHWARD OVER THE WESTERN RIDGE... 
BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY... 
EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS OF THE ALASKAN SOUTH COAST AND THE PANHANDLE WHERE THE 
PACIFIC STORM TRACK SHOULD FAVOR WET CONDITIONS... AND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST 
EXTENDING INTO THE GREAT LAKES WHICH WILL BE NEAR OR AHEAD OF THE EASTERN 
TROUGH.  THE RIDGE BUILDS INTO EASTE
