Like clockwork, Atlantis lifted off this morning right on time at 9:56
am EDT to begin the STS-46 mission.  The ascent into exceptionally
clear Florida skies was absolutely nominal.  First and second stage
performance were right on the money.  Atlantis is now in a circular
267-statute-mile-high orbit.  The flight crew will spend the afternoon
activating the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier
spacecraft and then deploy it from the payload bay early tomorrow
morning.  On Sunday, the STS-46 crew will begin to carry out a series
of experiments with the Tethered Satellite System.  The Italian-built
TSS satellite will be deployed on Monday.  This will be the first time
a satellite has ever been deployed on a long tether in spe, transponder frequency is 3960 MegaHertz, audio subcarrier is
6.8 MHz, polarization is vertical.
