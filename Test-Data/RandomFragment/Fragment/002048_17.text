BEAN MARKET SUMMARY

BEANS

    Dry Edible Bean market activity has picked up in recent weeks with the most 
active being noted on Pinto and Black beans with the increased demand from Mexico.  
However, this week trading became slow at current price levels, as some participants 
were waiting on the Government purchases to be announced later this week on the 2630 
MT of pinto beans. There is concern in the Great Northern market due very light 
demand for heavy supply. Uncertainty, among buyers and sellers has been caused the 
unsettled market conditions.   Ho
