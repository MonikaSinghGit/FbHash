                   A Board of Schools of Radiation Therapy Technology, American Medical
                   Association Council of Medical Education was established December 1,
                   1968.  Applicants for admission to approved schools must be
                   graduates of approved schools of radiology technology, RNs with a
                   course in radiation physics or such equivalent that is acceptable

                 to the American Registry of Radiology Technology.  Minimum training
                 required is 12 mo nths.  There are approximately 6 approved schools with
                 6 others pending action.

                 Other Federal     ort

                 The Cancer Control Program, Division of Chronic Diseases, has
                 supported ten training programs in radiation therapy technology
                 for about three years.  Beginning in FY 1968, funding authority
                 for these grants was transferred to Comprehensive Health Planning
                 Program of Cor@miunity Health Service, under the authority of
                 Section 314(3) of the Public Health Servi-ce-Act.  As in the case
                 of cytotechnology training, there will be no allocation of funds
                 for these projects beyond the end of FY 1969.
