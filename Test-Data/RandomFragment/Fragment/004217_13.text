ossal gas reservoir.   Early X-ray 
observations indicated that the gas in the inner regions of Hydra 
A should be cooling and slowly settling into the center of the 
cluster to form new galaxies or hundreds of trillions of dim 
stars.  As astronomers began searching for this cool matter, they 
were puzzled to find that the new galaxies and stars were not 
detected in sufficient numbers.

     The Chandra results on Hydra A, which is 840 million light 
years from Earth, may point to a resolution of this problem.  The 
inflow of cooling gas may be deflected by magnetic fields, and 
even pushed back into the cluster by explosions from the vicinity 
of a supermassive black hole at the core of the central galaxy.

     "In Hydra, you can see the whole cycle," said Brian McNamara 
of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  "You have the 
hot gas cloud, the disk of material feeding the black hole, and 
the evidence that the explosion from the gas near the black hole 
is pushing the hot gas around."

     Indeed, combined radio and X-ray observations suggest that a 
vast bubble of high energy particles is pushing the hot gas aside, 
creating the Hydra-like loops of hot gas.  Similar processes are 
likely to b
