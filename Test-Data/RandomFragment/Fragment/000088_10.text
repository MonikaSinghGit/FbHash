able timber land is tributary to the town by water. As nearly all the productive wheat land of the Columbia basin must be supplied with lumber and fuel from other places. a great part of this lumber and fuel must be distributed by rail from Spokane Falls in return for the wheat which will come there to be ground into flour and carried below for shipment to Europe. The town has already churches, public and private schools, newspapers, flouring and other mills, and is growing rapidly. Cheney, another flourishing town, situated on the railroad, is the seat of the District Court, and also of the land office of the Northern Pacific Railroad.
Stevens County, situated in the northeastern part of the Territory, adjoining Brilish Columbia, is one of the largest counties. Very little of its area has been surveyed, and it is quite sparsely settled, the population in 1880 being only 1,245. Value of taxable property, in 1881, $164,719; assessed acreage, 2,720. Its surface is that of a great rolling plateau, having many deep valleys, called coul6es, the channels of former water courses, with soil of the best sort for grain and grass. The country is well watered by countless streams, and is free from alkali. There are growths of good timber, consisting of spruce, white pine and large tamarack throughout the region, interspersed with open arable land, which produces good crops of wheat and vegetables, as well as melons and tomatoes, wherever it has been tried. The immense Colville country offers the very best inducements to settlers, 21,000: assessed acreage, 134,861. Population, 8,716. The country is a high rolling prairie, well watered by many rivers and their lateral branches. About three-fourths of the land is arable, and experience has proved it to be extremely fertile, producing wheat, barley and oats.
