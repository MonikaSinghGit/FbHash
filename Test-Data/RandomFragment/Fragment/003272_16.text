ndent Storms received six ounces of cocaine as theirpayment, and Storms sold it for them.  Tr. 115-117.  /8/   During the next several months, some 10 one-kilo shipments ofcocaine were made from Becerra in Florida through [John Doe] torespondent Storms for sale.  [John Doe] delivered Becerra's paymentspersonally or transmitted them by air transport disguised as printedmatter.  Tr. 117-119, 122, 124-128.   Two more transactions occurred at the end of May 1980.  On May 29,[John Doe] sold Storms two kilos of cocaine he had brought from Miami.Tr. 151-152.  When Storms made partial payment of $105,000 the nextday, he told [John Doe] he needed three more kilos.  [John Doe] immediatelyflew to Florida for the cocaine and returned, accompanied by Becerra.Storms later paid $180,000 for the shipment.  Tr. 153-155, 157-158;CR401-406.  /9/   The last two sales occurred in July 1980. [John Doe] brought a kiloof cocaine to Tucson, gave it to Storms for sale, and transmittedabout $60,000 to Becerra by an air express package service (Tr.159-161).  /10/ Shortly afterward, on behalf of Becerra (hisbrother-in-law) respondent Valenzuela delivered three kilos of cocaineto Storms.  For this shipment, Becerra received $175,000 in threeinstallments, one of which Valenzuela delivered on the return trip.Tr. 162-166.  /11/   2. During the first day of this five-day trial, one of the jurors,Garold Graham, observed respondent Gagnon sketching portraits ofmembers of the jury.  He became concerned and informed the bailiff,who then informed the trial judge.  Out of the presence of the jury(see Tr. 177), the court told Gagnon and his attorney that it was"very improper for a defendant to draw pictures of a jury whilethey're sitting in the box" and confiscated the sketches.  App.,infra, 18a;  Tr. 188.   Respondent Gagnon's attorney requested the court to interview jurorGraham to determine whether his concern over the incident might "be inthe nature of prejudice against Mr. Gagnon." App., infra, 19a;  Tr.188-189.  /12/ The trial judge agreed.  In open court (though stillout of the presence of the jury), she announced (App., infra, 19a;Tr. 189):  "I will talk to the juror in my chambers, and make adetermination.  We'll stand at recess." The transcript reveals thatrespondents and their counsel were present in the courtroom at thattime (Tr. 100).   A transcript of the in-chambers conference, which is reprinted infull at App., infra, 19a-22a, was prepared and made available to allparties.  App., infra, 5a.  Respondent Gagnon's attorney was presentand participated in questioning the juror.  None of the otherattorneys for the defendants or the government requested to be presentor attended;  nor did any of the defendants request to be personallypresent.  /13/   At the conference, the trial judge explained to juror Graham thatGagnon is an "artist" and that the sketching was "just one of thosethings that happened.  The Court has stopped it.  It won't continue."App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 189-190.  She then asked the juror whether theincident would "affect you in any way." App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 190.The juror responded (ibid.):      As far as any judgment on what's going on, it doesn't affect me.       I just thought that perhaps because of the seriousness of the      trial, and because of -- whichever way the deliberations go, it      kind of -- it upset me, because -- of what could happen      afterwards.The judge then inquired whether "it upset you to the extent that youcouldn't judge Mr. Gagnon fairly." The juror responded, "No." Thejudge pursued the matter, and juror Graham repeatedly avowed that hecould be fair to everyone concerned.  Ibid.   Graham informed the judge and defense counsel that one other jurorhad mentioned that he had noticed Gagnon's sketching, but that thejuror "didn't know what it was." App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 191.  No otherjurors had mentioned observing the incident.  App., infra, 21a;  Tr.191.   At this juncture, the trial judge asked Gagnon's attorney whetherhe was "satisf(ied)" with the results of the interview.  The attorneyposed two questions to juror Graham:  whether his conversation withthe bailiff had taken place in front of other jurors, and whether theincident would "prejudice you in any way against Mr. Gagnon." Grahamassured the attorney that the conversation with the bailiff was in thehallway, away from the other jurors, and that he would not beprejudiced against Gagnon.  App., infra, 21a;  Tr. 191-192.   On the basis of this interview, the trial judge concluded not todismiss the juror;  she instructed him not to discuss anything aboutthe matter with the other jurors.  She then asked defense counselwhether the outcome of the conference was "agreeable with you." App.,infra, 21a-22a;  Tr. 192.  Gagnon's attorney replied, "Yes," and theconference was completed.  Ibid.  Neither then nor at any other timedid any of the attorneys for respondents move to disqualify jurorGraham or the other juror who witnessed the sketching.  Nor was anyobjection made to conducting the conference in the absence of thedefendants.   3. The court of appeals reversed the convictions on the ground(App., infra, 6a-7a) that respondents' right "to be present duringcommunications between the judge and the jury," grounded in theConstitution, principles of jury trial, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 43, wasviolated by the conference with juror Graham.  The court held thatrespondents had not waived their right to be present at the conferenceby their failure to ask to attend.  Insofar as that right isconstitutionally based, the court held that the standard for waiver isthe "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right orprivilege" test of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938) -- astandard the court held was not satisfied here.  App., infra, 11a.   The court of appeals rejected the government's argument thatrespondents, having failed to object to the conference at trial, couldnot raise the issue on appeal.  Although invoking the "plain error"exception of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), the court made no finding thatthe procedure followed by the trial court had "affect(ed) substantialrights" of the accused, as Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) requires.  Itconcluded instead that "(a) criminal defendant's right to be presentat every stage of his trial is so fundamental that, in certaincircumstances, its violation must be noticed by a reviewing courtregardless of a failure to raise the issue below." App., infra, 11an.2(citing Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 41 (1975)).   Finally, the court of appeals found that the infringement ofrespondents' personal right to be present at the conference was notharmless beyond a reasonable doubt, on the ground that "(t)he presenceof the defendants was necessary in order to safeguard anotherconstitutional right -- the right to an impartial jury" (App., infra,13a).  While "unable to say on this record that the right to animpartial jury was infringed," the court found that it could not "saywith assurance that the absence was harmless." Id. at 13a-14a.   Judge Skopil dissented (App., infra, 14a-15a).  He would have heldthat respondents' interests were adequately represented by Gagnon'scounsel, and that the conference with the juror thus constitutedharmless error.  "It is difficult to conceive of any value from thepresence of defendants and the remaining defense attorneys.  Theirquestions would have been mere surplusage to those posed by (Gagnon'sattorney) and the court." Ibid.  Indeed, Judge Skopil stated, "(t)headded presence of the defendants and their counsel would have been * ** quite possibly detrimental to their interest." I
