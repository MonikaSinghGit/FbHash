ain, supra.  The instant decision, from the samecourt of appeals, is in a similar vein, but with potentially morefar-reaching consequences.  /31/   It was in precisely the same context of a supposed infringement onthe right to be present that this Court stated in Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U.S. at 122:      There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into      contempt -- that discredit will even touch the great immunities      assured by the Fourteenth Amendment -- if gossamer possibilities      of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence pronounced      by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience to * * * law,      and set the guilty free.                              CONCLUSION   The petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted.   Respectfully submitted.   Rex E. Lee      Solicitor General   Stephen S. Trott      Assistant Attorney General   Andrew L.
