because of the initial conditions (same
from the mine soil bank plots) and was suprised to see how much C
accumulated.

There is another mistake in this table as well so if you are going through
the table you may be perplexed by this as well.  I attach below a reply to
another keen observer of our calculations.  I guess I need to construct an
errata page.

I would be interested in hearing more about the manuscript you are
preparing.

Sorry - this is embarrasing.  Something got shifted in my table somewhere
along the long trajectory of the manuscript.  The 310 value should be for
a 10 year old pine plantation (CF2) with 9.3 kgC/m2.  For the starting
point I averaged CA2 and CA3 for a value of 6.2 kgC/m2.

The 51 year old Mahogany (LF6 - 11.4 kgC/m2) should have been 102 gC/m2/y
[1000(11.4-6.2/51)].  This seems to be missing from my table.  The
difference between this and yours is that I decided to average CA2 and CA3
for the initial condition here as well.  I averaged things
together in this paper in an attempt to cut down on the effect of various
sources of variation involved in soil carbon measurements.  We will also
differ in just transcribing bar charts into numerical values.

Thanks for your interest in our paper.  I do have a couple of more recent
papers.  I'll send the cites along shortly.
