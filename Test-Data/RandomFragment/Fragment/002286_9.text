                             Issues

     Whether  the appropriate SIC code for a procurement  seeking
to  lease  equipment  is  one  which  covers  the  lease  of  the
particular  type  of  equipment, rather than the  manufacture  or
wholesale distribution of that equipment.

     Whether  the appropriate SIC code for a procurement  seeking
to  lease  portable  light towers is 7359, Equipment  Rental  and
Leasing,  Not Elsewhere Classified; or 5063, Electrical Apparatus
and Equipment, Wiring Supplies, and Construction Materials.


                         I.  BACKGROUND
                                
     On  December 2, 1997, the Contracting Officer (CO)  for  the
Department  of  Justice,  Immigration and Naturalization  Service
(INS),  issued this small business set aside solicitation seeking
to  lease  portable light towers for one year, with two  one-year
options.   The  CO  classified  the  procurement  under  Standard
Industrial  Classification (SIC) code 5063, Electrical  Apparatus
and  Equipment, Wiring Supplies, and Construction Materials, with
a 100-employee size standard.  INS seeks to lease 60 towers, each
a  self-contained unit with a diesel generator powering a bank of
four 1,000-watt floodlights, mounted on a trailer and capable  of
functioning under desert conditions.
     
     Bids  were  originally due on December  17,  1997.   The  CO
issued  Amendment  1 to the solicitation on December  5th,  which
required that the contractor be responsible for normal preventive
and scheduled maintenance; and the INS be responsible for repairs
due to negligence of Government personnel and vandalism.  The  CO
issued  Amendment 2 on December 10th, which contained a form  for
offerors to submit their bids.
     
     On  December  12, 1997, Weldon Rents Equipment  (Appellant),
filed the instant appeal.  Appellant asserts the appropriate  SIC
code  is  7359,  Equipment  Rental  and  Leasing,  Not  Elsewhere
Classified,  with  a corresponding average annual  receipts  size
standard  of $5 million.  Appellant asserts leasing equipment  to
the government clearly is a business service, and the procurement
should be classified under a service SIC code.

                         II.  DISCUSSION

      Appellant filed this appeal within ten calendar days of the
solicitation's  issuance.   Therefore,  the  instant  appeal   is
timely.  13 C.F.R. Section 134.304(a)(3).

      In a SIC appeal, Appellant has the burden of proving, by  a
preponderance  of  the  evidence, error  in  the  CO's  SIC  code
designation.   SIC  Appeal  of the Scientific  Consulting  Group,
Inc., No. 4186 (1996).  The correct SIC code for a procurement is
that  which best describes the principal purpose of the  services
being  procured, in light of the industry description in the  SIC
Manual, [1] the description in the solicitation, and the relative
weight  of  each  element of the solicitation.   Id.;  13  C.F.R.
Section  121.402(b).  The standard of review is whether  the  SIC
code  designation is based on a clear error of fact or  law.   13
C.F.R.
Section  134.314; SIC Appeal of Information Ventures,  Inc.,  No.
4266 (1997).

      SIC code 5063 is part of Major Group 50 - Wholesale Trade -
Durable Goods, and covers establishments primarily engaged in the
wholesale  distribution of electrical power equipment, electrical
construction  materials, and electric light fixtures  and  bulbs.
SIC Manual, pp. 289, 295.  In contrast, SIC code 7359 is part  of
Major  Group  73  - Business Services, and covers  establishments
primarily  engaged in renting or leasing equipment not classified
under   other  SIC  codes,  which  includes  leasing   electronic
equipment.  SIC Manual, pp. 360, 364.

      When the purpose of a procurement is to lease, rather  than
purchase,   equipment,   this  Office's   precedent   holds   the
appropriate  SIC  code is one which covers  the  leasing  of  the
particular  type  of equipment, rather than the manufacturing  or
wholesale distribution of that equipment.  SIC Appeals  of  Trico
Rentals,  Inc.,  No. 3619 (1992); Gell Service Industries,  Inc.,
No.  3456  (1991);  and Associate Administrator  for  Procurement
Assistance, No. 14
