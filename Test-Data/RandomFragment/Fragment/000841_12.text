Like clockwork, Atlantis lifted off this morning right on time at 9:56
am EDT to begin the STS-46 mission.  The ascent into exceptionally
clear Florida skies was absolutely nominal.  First and second stage
performance were right on the money.  Atlantis is now in a circular
267-statute-mile-high orbit.  The flight crew will spend the afternoon
activating the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier
spacecraft and then deploy it from the payload bay early tomorrow
morning.  On Sunday, the STS-46 crew will begin to carry out a series
of experiments with the Tethered Satellite System.  The Italian-built
TSS satellite will be deployed on Monday.  This will be the first time
a satellite has ever been deployed on a long tether in space.  The
Tethered Satellite will be extended to a distance of 12-1/2 miles from
Atlantis.

Mission commander for this flight is Loren Shriver, who is making his
third shuttle flight.  Pilot is first-timer Andy Allen.  Mission
specialists for the flight are NASA astronauts Marsha Ivins, making her
second n latch function check, from Atlantis.
