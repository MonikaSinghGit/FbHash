Preface

The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), Title IV of the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322), improved
our country's response to violence against women, including domestic violence,
stalking, and sexual assault. VAWA and its recent reauthorization, the Violence
Against Women Act of 2000, have transformed criminal and civil justice system
efforts to address these serious crimes, bringing communities together to move
forward to end violence against women.

Police officers, prosecutors, victim advocates, and members of the judiciary are 
collaborating to leverage the coercive power of the criminal justice system to
enhance victim safety and hold offenders accountable. To help support these
initiatives, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP),
has provided tools and resources to implement coordinated community
responses to violence against women and to fund basic research to expand
understanding of stalking and domestic violence.

This report to Congress is part of an ongoing commitment to share information
about strategies that show promise in the field and about the development of
laws addressing stalking. It is produced in response to Subtitle F of VAWA,
which directs the U.S. Attorney General to submit a report on these issues.

Our knowledge about domestic violence and stalking continues to grow as a
result of innovative community-based strategies across the country. OJP is
committed to addressing these problems aggressively on several fronts by
providing resources to communities, supporting research to help understand
and develop more effective responses to stalking, and increasing public
awareness of these crimes, their consequences, and the resources available for
victims. 

OJP's Violence Against Women Office is supporting the newly established
National Resource Center on Stalking, which will collect information about
promising antistalking practices and assist communities in adapting these to their
needs. The National Institute of Justice continues to conduct research on
effective strategies to combat violence against women, including domestic
violence and stalking. 

State and Federal legislatures continue to pass legislation to hold stalkers
accountable. Since enactment of State antistalking laws, the number of stalking
cases reported to law enforcement has increased substantially. Similarly,
Federal prosecutors are enforcing the Federal antistalking statute by bringing
charges against stalkers in appropriate cases. These statutes and related
prosecutions communicate the message that stalking is criminal and will not be
tolerated. 

OJP thanks the many individuals involved in the preparation of this report for
their time and commitment, and gratefully acknowledges the invaluable
contributions of the many criminal justice professionals and victim services
providers contacted for this report.

Foreword

The passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 signified a
major shift in our national response to domestic violence, stalking, and sexual
assault crimes. For the first time, violent crimes against women were addressed
in relation to the more general problem of gender inequality. VAWA seeks to
eradicate violence against women at all levels.

Domestic violence is about control, power, and domination. While stalking may
be perpetrated by strangers, acquaintances, or current or former intimate
partners, stalking is most often committed against women in the domestic
violence context. When victims of domestic violence leave their abusers,
abusers often stalk victims in an effort to regain control. Because of this
increased risk of "separation violence," victims fear for their lives and for the
safety of their children.

The passage of stalking legislation by all 50 States and the District of Columbia
provides some measure of protection during this critical period. On the Federal
level, the seriousness of stalking was addressed when Congress passed the
interstate stalking law.[1] Stalking must be understood as part of the domestic
violence continuum and must be addressed forcefully.

With the growth of the Internet, cyberstalking crimes are increasing. The
Internet has become a useful tool for stalkers.[2] The veil of anonymity allows
the perpetrator to exercise power and control over the victim by threatening the
victim directly or posting messages that lead third parties to engage in
harassment and threatening behavior toward the victim.

This report to Congress provides information concerning stalking and the
effectiveness of State antistalking efforts and legislation. Strong enforcement of
stalking and cyberstalking laws, combined with a better understanding of the
dynamics underlying this criminal behavior, will enable us to address these
crimes more effectively.

As we work to eliminate all forms of violence against women, we gain
knowledge regarding the nature and scope of these crimes. Domestic violence
occurs on a continuum that ranges from emotional abuse to homicide, and the
escalation of violence often follows a predictable pattern. Our goal is to
formulate responses that break the cycle of violence through effective
intervention at the earliest stages. Understanding the nature of domestic violence
can help prevent the further escalation of criminal activity.

At the U.S. Department of Justice, we are firmly committed to facilitating the
awareness of and developing training on stalking. We have awarded funds to
communities for programs dedicated to developing effective antistalking
protocols and to others who seek to replicate promising practices in this area.
We are working closely with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices to bring prosecutions
under the Federal interstate stalking law when applicable. Together, through
increased communication and collaboration, we will send the message that
these crimes will not be tolerated.

Stalking creates a psychological prison that deprives its victims of basic liberty
of movement and security in their homes. We must address these crimes
effectively by working together to protect stalking victims and to hold
perpetrators responsible for their criminal behavior. To eradicate stalking, we
must act with the full force of the law.

Chapter 1 
Cyberstalking--A New Challenge for Law Enforcement

The Internet and other telecommunications technologies are advancing virtually
every aspect of society and every corner of the globe. They are fostering
commerce, improving education and health care, promoting participatory
democracy in the United States and abroad, and facilitating communications
among family and friends, whether across the street or around the world.
Unfortunately, many of the attributes of this technology--low cost, ease of use,
and its anonymous nature, among others--make it an attractive medium for
fraudulent scams, child sexual exploitation, and a new concern known as
"cyberstalking." 

This chapter explores the nature and extent of cyberstalking; surveys the steps
industry, law enforcement, and others are taking to address the problem;
analyzes the adequacy of current Federal and State laws; and provides
recommendations on how to improve efforts to stop this growing problem.

As discussed in this chapter, the nature and extent of cyberstalking are difficult
to know precisely. In addition, while some law enforcement agencies are
responding aggressively, others are not fully aware of the problem and lack the
expertise and resources to identify and pursue cyberstalking cases. Similarly,
while some Internet service providers (ISPs) have taken affirmative steps to
crack down on cyberstalking, others have not, and there is a great deal more
that industry can and should do to empower individuals to protect themselves
against cyberstalking and other online threats.

Indeed, current trends and evidence suggest that cyberstalking is a serious
problem that will grow in scope and complexity as more people use the Internet
and other telecommunications technologies. The analysis and recommendations
contained in this chapter offer a framework for an initial response to the
problem. These recommendations, however, are only a first step. Important
advances can be made if industry, law enforcement, victim support groups and
service providers, and others work together to develop a more comprehensive
and effective response to this problem. Ultimately, however, the first line of
defense will involve industry efforts that educate and empower individuals to
protect themselves against cyberstalking and other online threats, along with
prompt reporting to law enforcement agencies trained and equipped to respond
to cyberstalking incidents.

What Is Cyberstalking?

Although there is no universally accepted definition of cyberstalking, the term is
used in this chapter to refer to the use of the Internet, e-mail, and other
electronic communication devices to stalk another person. Stalking generally
involves harassing and threatening behavior that an individual engages in
repeatedly, such as following a person, appearing at a person's home or place
of business, making harassing phone calls, leaving written messages or objects,
or vandalizing a person's property. Most stalking laws require the perpetrator
to make a credible threat of violence against the victim. Others include threats
against the victim's immediate family, and still others require only that the
alleged stalker's course of conduct constitute an implied threat.[3] While some
conduct involving annoying or menacing behavior might fall short of illegal
stalking, such behavior may be a precursor of stalking and violence and should
be treated seriously.

Nature and Extent of Cyberstalking

An Existing Problem Aggravated by New Technology

Although online harassment and threats can take many forms, cyberstalking
shares important characteristics with offline stalking. Many stalkers--online or
offline--are motivated by a desire to exert control over their victims and will
engage in similar types of behavior to accomplish this end. As with offline
stalking, the available evidence (which is largely anecdotal) suggests that the
majority of cyberstalkers are men and the majority of their victims are women,
although there have been reported cases of women cyberstalking men and of
same-sex cyberstalking. In many cases, the cyberstalker and the victim had a
prior relationship, and the cyberstalking began when the victim attempted to
break off the relationship. However, there also have been many instances of
cyberstalking by strangers.

The fact that cyberstalking does not involve physical contact may create the
misperception that it is more benign than physical stalking. This is not
necessarily true. As the Internet becomes an evermore integral part of our
personal and professional lives, stalkers can take advantage of the ease of
communication as well as increased access to an enormous amount of personal
information that is available through the Internet. Indeed, a cyberstalker can
easily locate private information about a potential victim with a few mouse
clicks or keystrokes. In addition, the ease of use and the nonconfrontational,
impersonal, and sometimes anonymous nature of Internet communications may
remove disincentives to cyberstalking. Put another way, where a potential
stalker may be unwilling or unable to confront a victim in person or on the
telephone, he or she may have little hesitation sending harassing or threatening
electronic communications. Furthermore, as with physical stalking, online
harassment and threats may foreshadow more serious behavior, including
physical violence.

Despite the many similarities between offline and online stalking, the Internet
and other communications technologies provide new avenues for stalkers to
pursue their victims. A cyberstalker may send repeated, threatening, or
harassing messages by the simple push of a button. More sophisticated
cyberstalkers use programs to send messages at regular or random intervals
without being physically present at the computer terminal. California law
enforcement authorities say they have encountered situations in which victims
repeatedly received the message "187" on their pagers--the section of the
California Penal Code for murder. In addition, a cyberstalker can dupe other
Internet users into harassing or threatening a victim by, for example, posting a
victim's name, telephone number, or e-mail address on a bulletin board or in a
chat room with a controversial message or invitation, resulting in the victim
receiving multiple e-mails in response. Each message--whether from the actual
cyberstalker or others--will have the intended effect of frightening or harassing
the victim, with little effort on the part of the cyberstalker. Additionally, because
of the lack of direct contact between the cyberstalker and the victim, law
enforcement may have difficulty identifying, locating, and arresting the offender.

The anonymity of the Internet also provides new opportunities for would-be
cyberstalkers. A cyberstalker's true identity can be concealed from the recipient
by using different ISPs or by adopting different screen names. More
experienced stalkers can use anonymous remailers that make it all but
impossible to determine the true identity of the source of an e-mail or other
electronic communication. A number of law enforcement agencies report they
are confronting cyberstalking cases involving the use of anonymous remailers.

Anonymity is a great advantage for the cyberstalker. Unknown to the victim,
the perpetrator could be in another State, around the corner, or in the next
cubicle at work. The perpetrator could be a former friend or lover, a total
stranger met in a chat room, or simply a teenager playing a practical joke. A
victim's inability to identify the source of the harassment or threats can be
particularly ominous, and the veil of anonymity might encourage the perpetrator
to continue these acts. In addition, the substantial amount of personal
information available through the Internet can make cyberstalking relatively easy
to do. Numerous Web sites provide unlisted telephone numbers and detailed
directions to a home or office. For a fee, other Web sites promise to provide
social security numbers, financial data, and other personal information.

Evidence Suggests Cyberstalking Incidents Are Increasing

Although comprehensive nationwide data on the extent of cyberstalking in the
United States do not yet exist, there is a growing body of statistics available
from law enforcement agencies, as well as from some ISPs, that compile
information on the number and types of complaints of harassment and threats
involving ISP subscribers. There is increasing anecdotal and informal evidence
on the nature and extent of cyberstalking, and research addressing offline
stalking may provide insight into the scope of the problem. According to the
most recent National Violence Against Women Survey, which defines stalking
as involving instances where the victim felt a high level of fear:[4]

o One out of every 12 women (8.2 million) in the United States and 1 out of
every 45 men (2 million) have been stalked at some time in their lives.

o One percent of all women and 0.4 percent of all men had been stalked during
the 12 months preceding the survey.

----------------------------

Offline Versus Online Stalking: A Comparison

Major Similarities

o The majority of cases involve stalking by former intimates, although stranger
stalking occurs in the real world and in cyberspace.

o Most victims are women; most stalkers are men. 

o Stalkers are generally motivated by the desire to control the victim.

Major Differences

o Offline stalking generally requires the perpetrator and the victim to be in the
same geographic area; cyberstalkers may be across the street or across the
country.

o Electronic communication technologies make it much easier for a
cyberstalker to encourage third parties to harass or threaten a victim (e.g., a
stalker will impersonate the victim and post inflammatory messages on bulletin
boards and in chat rooms, causing viewers of these messages to send
threatening messages back to the victim).

o Electronic communication technologies also lower the barriers to harassment
and threats; a cyberstalker does not need to physically confront the victim.

----------------------------

o Women are far more likely than men to be victims of stalking--nearly 80
percent of stalking victims are women. Men are far more likely to be stalkers,
comprising 87 percent of the stalkers identified by victims participating in the
survey.

o Women are twice as likely as men to be victims of stalking by strangers and
eight times as likely to be victims of stalking by intimates.

In the United States today, more than 80 million adults and 10 million children
have access to the Internet. Assuming the proportion of cyberstalking victims is
even a fraction of the proportion of persons who have been the victims of
offline stalking, there may be potentially tens or even hundreds of thousands of
victims of cyberstalking incidents each year in the United States.


----------------------------

Actual Cyberstalking Incidents

o In the first successful prosecution under California's new cyberstalking law,
prosecutors in the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office obtained a guilty plea
from a 50-year-old former security guard who used the Internet to solicit the
rape of a woman who rejected his romantic advances. The defendant terrorized
his 28-year-old victim by impersonating her in various Internet chat rooms and
online bulletin boards, where he posted, along with her telephone number and
address, messages that she fantasized of being raped. On at least six occasions,
sometimes in the middle of the night, men knocked on the woman's door saying
they wanted to rape her. The former security guard pleaded guilty in April 1999
to one count of stalking and three counts of solicitation of sexual assault. He
faces up to 6 years in prison.

o A local prosecutor's office in Massachusetts charged a man who, using
anonymous remailers, allegedly engaged in a systematic pattern of harassment
of a coworker, which culminated in an attempt to extort sexual favors from the
victim under threat of disclosing past sexual activities to the victim's new
husband. 

o An honors graduate from the University of San Diego terrorized five female
university students over the Internet for more than a year. The victims received
hundreds of violent and threatening e-mails, sometimes receiving four or five
messages a day. The graduate student, who has entered a guilty plea and faces
up to 6 years in prison, told police he committed the crimes because he thought
the women were laughing at him and causing others to ridicule him. In fact, the
victims had never met him.

----------------------------

Anecdotal evidence from Federal law enforcement agencies further indicates
that cyberstalking is a serious and growing problem. At the Federal level,
several dozen matters have been referred, usually by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), to U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) for possible action. A
number of these cases have been referred to State and local law enforcement
agencies because the conduct does not appear to violate Federal law.

Local law enforcement agencies are beginning to see cases of cyberstalking as
well. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office estimated recently that e-mail
or other electronic communication is a factor in approximately 20 percent of the
roughly 600 cases referred to its Stalking and Threat Assessment Unit. The
chief of the Sex Crimes Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office also
estimates that about 20 percent of the unit's cases involve cyberstalking. The
Computer Investigations and Technology Unit of the New York City Police
Department estimates that almost 40 percent of its caseload involves electronic
threats and harassment--and virtually all of these have occurred in the past 3 or
4 years. 

ISPs are also receiving a growing number of complaints about harassing and
threatening behavior online. One major ISP reported receiving approximately
15 complaints per month of cyberstalking, in comparison to virtually no
complaints of cyberstalking just 1 or 2 years ago.

Finally, as part of a large study on sexual victimization of college women,
researchers at the University of Cincinnati conducted a national telephone
survey during the 1996-97 academic year of 4,446 randomly selected women
attending 2- and 4-year institutions of higher education. For the survey, the
researchers defined a stalking incident as one in which a respondent answered
positively when asked if someone had "repeatedly followed you, watched you,
phoned, written, e-mailed, or communicated with you in other ways that
seemed obsessive and made you afraid or concerned for your safety." The
study found that 581 women (13.1 percent) had been stalked and reported a
total of 696 stalking incidents (the latter figure exceeds the number of victims
because 15 percent of the women experienced more than one case of stalking
during the survey period). Of the 696 stalking incidents, 166 (23.9 percent)
involved e-mail. Thus, 25 percent of stalking incidents among college women
could be classified as involving cyberstalking.[5]

Current Efforts to Address Cyberstalking

The Law Enforcement Response

Cyberstalking is a relatively new challenge for most law enforcement agencies.
The first traditional stalking law was enacted by California in 1990. Since then,
some law enforcement agencies have trained their personnel on stalking and
have established specialized units to handle stalking cases. Nonetheless, many
agencies are still developing the expertise and resources to investigate and
prosecute traditional stalking cases. Only a handful of agencies throughout the
country have focused attention or resources specifically on the cyberstalking
problem.[6]

Law Enforcement Response: Awareness and Training Are Key Factors

Based on recent informal surveys of law enforcement agencies, it appears that
the majority of law enforcement agencies have not investigated or prosecuted
cyberstalking cases. However, some agencies--particularly those with units
dedicated to stalking or computer crime offenses--report having large
cyberstalking caseloads.

The disparity in the activity level among law enforcement agencies can be
attributed to a number of factors. First, it appears that most cyberstalking
victims do not report the conduct to law enforcement because they feel either
the behavior has not reached the point of being a crime or that law enforcement
will not take them seriously. Second, most law enforcement agents have not
been trained to recognize the serious nature of cyberstalking and to investigate
such offenses. Unfortunately, some victims have reported that rather than open
an investigation, law enforcement agencies have advised them to come back if
the cyberstalkers confront or threaten them offline. In several instances, victims
have been told by law enforcement simply to turn their computers off.

----------------------------

Cyberspace has become a fertile field for illegal activity. With the use of new
technology and equipment which cannot be policed by traditional methods,
cyberstalking has replaced traditional methods of stalking and harassment. In
addition, cyberstalking has led to offline incidents of violent crime. Police and
prosecutors need to be aware of the escalating numbers of these events and
devise strategies to resolve these problems through the criminal justice system.

--Linda Fairstein, Chief 
Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit 
Manhattan District Attorney's Office

----------------------------

Another indication that many law enforcement agencies may be unaware of the
magnitude of the cyberstalking problem is the wide disparity in the number of
cases reported in different jurisdictions across the country. For example, one
state attorney general's office in a Midwestern State indicated that it had been
receiving approximately one inquiry a week regarding cyberstalking cases and
knew of at least a dozen cases prosecuted throughout the State during the
preceding year. In contrast, the attorney general's offices in neighboring States
reported they had never received an inquiry about cyberstalking. Although
some disparity among jurisdictions would be expected, the size of the disparity
suggests that not all law enforcement agencies are receiving the training or
expertise needed to identify and respond to the problem.


----------------------------

Lack of Training Hinders Law Enforcement Response

A woman filed a complaint with her local police agency after receiving
numerous telephone calls in response to a notice posted on the Web by a man
claiming her 9-year-old daughter was available for sex, and providing her home
phone number with instructions to call 24 hours a day. The agency's response
was that she should change her telephone number. Instead she contacted the
FBI, which opened an investigation. It was discovered that the local police
agency did not have a computer expert and the investigative officer had never
used the Internet. The local agency's lack of familiarity and resources may have
resulted in a failure to understand the seriousness of the problem and the
response options available to law enforcement.

----------------------------

Law Enforcement Response: Jurisdictional and Statutory Limitations May
Frustrate Some Agencies

Cyberstalking also raises jurisdictional issues for law enforcement that can
frustrate agencies' attempts to address it. In many cases, the cyberstalker may
be in one city or State and the victim may be in another, making it more difficult
(and sometimes all but impossible) for the local authority to investigate the
incident. Even when a law enforcement agency is willing to pursue a case
across State lines, cooperation from agencies in neighboring States may not be
forthcoming when the conduct is limited to harassing e-mail messages and no
actual violence has occurred. A number of cases of suspected cyberstalking
have been referred to the FBI and USAOs because questions of jurisdiction
kept local law enforcement from pursuing the investigation.

The lack of adequate statutory authority further limits law enforcement's
response to cyberstalking incidents. At least 16 States have stalking statutes
that explicitly cover electronic communications,[7] and cyberstalking may be
covered under general stalking statutes in other States. In the remaining States,
however, cyberstalking may not meet the statutory definition of stalking and
therefore may not be considered a crime. In many cases, cyberstalking involves
threats to kill, kidnap, or injure a person or damage his or her reputation or
property and may be prosecuted under Federal or State laws that do not relate
directly to stalking.

Federal law may also limit law enforcement's ability to track down stalkers and
other criminals in cyberspace. In particular, the Cable Communications Policy
Act of 1984 (CCPA) prohibits the disclosure of cable subscriber records to
law enforcement agencies without a court order and advance notice to the
subscriber (47 U.S.C. ss 551(c), (h)). As more and more individuals turn to
cable companies as their ISPs, CCPA is posing a significant obstacle to the
investigation of cybercrimes, including cyberstalking. For example, under
CCPA, a law enforcement agency investigating a cyberstalker who uses a cable
company for Internet access would have to notify the cyberstalker that the
agency has requested his or her subscriber records, thereby jeopardizing the
criminal investigation. While it is appropriate to prohibit the indiscriminate
disclosure of cable records to law enforcement agencies, the better approach
would be to harmonize Federal law by providing law enforcement access to
cable subscriber records under the same privacy safeguards that currently
govern law enforcement access to records of electronic mail subscribers under
18 U.S.C. ss 2703. Moreover, special provisions could be drafted to protect
against the inappropriate disclosure of records that would reveal a customer's
viewing habits.

Law Enforcement Response: The Challenge of Anonymity

Another complication for law enforcement investigation of cyberstalking cases
is the presence of services that enable anonymous communications over the
Internet. Although anonymity provides important benefits for Internet users,
including protection of privacy, as discussed earlier, it also provides
cyberstalkers with advantages over both their victims and law enforcement.

Anonymity on the Internet can be obtained in one of two ways. The first is by
buying Internet services that allow individuals to create free electronic
mailboxes through a Web site. While most ISPs request identifying information
from users of this service, they almost never authenticate or otherwise confirm
the information. In addition, payment for these services is typically made in
advance through a money order or other nontraceable form. As long as
payment is received in advance, the service is provided to the account holder
who may remain unknown. The second way is by using e-mail servers that
purposefully strip identifying information and transport headers from the e-mail.
By forwarding e-mail through several of these services serially, a stalker can
make the message completely anonymous. The availability of both types of
service makes it relatively easy for cyberstalkers to send anonymous
communications but very difficult for victims, service providers, and law
enforcement to identify the communications source.

Law Enforcement Response: Specialized Units Show Promise in Combating
Cyberstalking


A critical step in combating cyberstalking is understanding stalking in general.
Because offline and online stalking share some characteristics, many strategies
and techniques that have been developed to combat stalking in general often
can be adapted to cyberstalking situations.

At the Federal level, the Justice Department has established a number of task
forces and special crime units that focus solely on high-technology crimes.
These units do not address cyberstalking alone, but they have the necessary
expertise in computers and the Internet to assist in the investigation of
cyberstalking when it arises. For example, the FBI has computer crime squads
throughout the country, as well as the National Infrastructure Protection Center
in Washington, D.C., to ensure cybercrimes are properly investigated.
Additionally, they have computer analysis and response teams to conduct
forensic examinations on seized magnetic media. Similarly, in 1996, the Justice
Department established the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
within the Criminal Division, which is a unit with highly trained personnel who
remain on the cutting edge of new technology and investigative techniques. In
addition, each U.S. Attorney's Office contains experienced computer crime
prosecutors who help investigate and prosecute a variety of computer crimes,
including cyberstalking. They work closely with State-level special divisions that
have been established in several State attorney generals' offices to focus on
computer crimes.

Some larger metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and New York City,
have seen numerous incidents of cyberstalking and have created special crime
units to investigate and prosecute these cases. The Los Angeles Stalking and
Threat Assessment Team combines special sections of the police department
and district attorney's office to ensure properly trained investigators and
prosecutors are available when cyberstalking cases arise. In addition, the unit is
given adequate resources, including computer hardware and advanced training,
which are essential for investigating and prosecuting these technical cases.
Similarly, the New York City Police Department's Computer Investigation and
Technology Unit provides regular training for police officers and prosecutors
regarding the intricacies of cyberstalking investigations and prosecutions. The
training focuses on understanding how chat rooms operate, how to obtain and
preserve electronic evidence, and how to draft search warrants and subpoenas.

The programs in New York City and Los Angeles both ensure that
enforcement personnel have the resources and training needed to fight
cyberstalking. Traditional law enforcement techniques for surveillance,
investigation, and evidence gathering require modification for use on computer
networks and often require the use of unfamiliar legal processes. Law
enforcement at all levels must be properly trained to use network investigative
techniques and legal processes while protecting the privacy of legitimate users
of the Internet. Just as a burglar might leave fingerprints at the scene of a crime,
a cyberstalker can leave an "electronic trail" on the Web that properly trained
law enforcement personnel can follow back to the source.

Cyberstalking is expected to increase as computers and the Internet become
more popular. Accordingly, law enforcement at all levels must become more
sensitive to cyberstalking complaints and devote the necessary training and
resources to allow proper investigation and prosecution. By becoming
technologically proficient and understanding stalking in general, agencies will be
better prepared to respond to cyberstalking incidents in their jurisdictions. In
addition, State and local agencies can turn to their local FBI office or USAO
for technical assistance. Also, computer crime units and domestic violence units
should share information and expertise, because many cyberstalking cases
include elements of both computer crime and domestic violence. Finally, law
enforcement must become more sensitive to the fear and frustration
experienced by cyberstalking victims. Proper training should help in this regard,
but law enforcement at all levels should take the next step and place special
emphasis on this problem. Computers and the Internet are becoming
indispensable parts of America's culture, and cyberstalking is a growing threat.
Responding to a victim's complaint by saying "turn off your computer" or
"change your telephone number" is not acceptable.

Industry Efforts

Although the Internet industry has tried to combat abusive electronic
communications overall, it has not addressed cyberstalking in particular. Most
major ISPs have established an address to which complaints of abusive or
harassing electronic mail can be sent (generally, this address is abuse@[the
ISP's domain]). In addition, these providers almost uniformly have provisions in
their online agreements prohibiting abusive or harassing conduct through their
service and stipulate that violations of the policy will result in termination of the
account.

In practice, however, ISPs have focused more on assisting their customers in
avoiding annoying online behavior, such as receiving unsolicited commercial
e-mail (spamming) or large amounts of e-mail intentionally sent to an individual
(mail bombing). Less attention has been paid to helping victims of cyberstalking
or other electronic threats. For some ISPs, the procedures for lodging
complaints of online harassment or threats are difficult to locate, and their
policies about what constitutes a violation of service agreements are generally
not helpful. In addition, many ISPs do not inform their customers about what
steps, if any, the ISP has taken to followup on customer complaints. These
problems--hard-to-locate complaint procedures, vague policies about what
does and does not constitute prohibited harassment, and inadequate followup
on complaints--may pose serious obstacles to cyberstalking victims who need
help.

Online industry associations respond that providing such protection to their
customers is costly and difficult. Although they recognize that larger ISPs have
begun to commit resources to dealing with harassment online, they caution that
the costs of imposing additional reporting or response obligations on ISPs may
make it difficult for small or entrepreneurial ISPs to continue providing service
at competitive rates. For example, the Commercial Internet Exchange, whose
members carry approximately 75 percent of United States backbone traffic,
cautions that no attempt to impose reporting requirements should be made
unless fully justified by the record. However, according to the same group, the
decentralized nature of the Internet would make it difficult for providers to
collect and submit such data. Accordingly, evidence of the scope of the
cyberstalking problem is likely to be defined primarily by growing anecdotal
evidence with limited factual basis to determine whether the phenomenon is
growing, static, or declining.

Industry Efforts: Educating and Protecting Consumers

Despite the difficulty in fully defining the scope of the cyberstalking problem, the
industry has made notable efforts to inform consumers about ways to protect
themselves online. Such information is principally focused on protecting children
and consumers on the Internet. For example, since 1996, the Internet Alliance,
one of the key Internet industry groups, has worked with the Federal Trade
Commission and government agencies on Project OPEN (Online Public
Education Network). Project OPEN provides information about fraud, parental
controls, and privacy protection. Although this information is not specifically
relevant to cyberstalking, much of the advice about protecting children and
safeguarding privacy while online may be of assistance to individuals who want
to use the Internet while being protected against potential cyberstalkers. More
recently, a number of industry organizations have joined together to develop
GetNetWise.Com--a single, comprehensive online resource to help parents and
children use the Internet in a safe and educational manner.

Other similar industry efforts have been announced to address aspects of
computer-related crime. For example, the Justice Department and the
Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) announced the
Cybercitizen Partnership in March 1999. This partnership is intended to boost
cooperation between industry and government, expand public awareness of
computer crime issues among children and adolescents, and provide resources
for government to draw on in addressing computer crime. The industry has also
responded to the complaints of parents who are worried about the content
available to their children over the Internet. The One Click Away initiative gives
parents important information about protecting their children in one central
location. Similar education and outreach efforts, approached through
cooperation between industry and government, may educate individuals
concerned about these issues and mitigate some of the dangers of
cyberstalking.

Other Internet industry sectors have begun to address aspects of the
cyberstalking problem. Many of their solutions focus on the ability of individuals
to protect themselves against unwanted communications. For example, most
Internet chat facilities offer users the ability to block, squelch, or ignore chat
messages or "paging" from individuals who are attempting to annoy or threaten
them. Similarly, many e-mail users have tools that allow them to block e-mail
from individuals who are attempting to harass or annoy them. Such a solution
may be useful in situations where the communications are merely annoying.
Unfortunately, such a solution is less appropriate when threatening
communications are received, because victims who never "receive" the threat
may not know they are being stalked and may be alerted, for the first time,
when the stalker shows up to act on the threat.

In another type of response, providers have set up gated communities for
individuals, families, and children. The techniques used by these communities
are still in the developmental stages and range from specialized servers, which
allow potentially objectionable content to be filtered at the server, to designated
areas for children and teens, which place restrictions on the amount or types of
personal information that will be provided to others. Individuals who are
concerned about being stalked may find refuge in these communities.

While these efforts all reflect important initiatives for self-protection, both
industry and government representatives agree that a key component of
addressing the cyberstalking problem is education and empowerment. If
individuals are given direction about how to protect themselves against
threatening or harassing communications, and how to report incidents when
they do occur, both the industry and law enforcement will be in positions to
cooperate in conducting investigations.

Industry Efforts: Cooperation With Law Enforcement

Both industry and law enforcement benefit when crime over the Internet is
reduced. In particular, the Internet industry benefits significantly whenever
citizen and consumer confidence and trust in the Internet are increased.
Accordingly, both industry and law enforcement recognize the need to
cooperate more fully with one another in this area. Industry representatives
have noted that contact between industry and law enforcement--particularly in
the area of harassment--is sporadic and episodic. Industry representatives, who
were consulted as part of the preparation of this chapter, indicated their
willingness to participate in training efforts for law enforcement. Law
enforcement personnel--particularly on the State and local levels, who are often
the first responders to cyberstalking complaints--should engage industry
representatives in dialogue and take advantage of the expertise offered by the
industry in designing training programs. Closer cooperation between law
enforcement and industry will ensure that law enforcement officers know whom
to call at the ISPs and how to proceed when they receive a complaint, and
ISPs will have a contact in law enforcement when they receive a complaint that
warrants intervention.

Adequacy of Existing Laws

State Cyberstalking Laws

Fewer than one-third of the States have antistalking laws that explicitly cover
cyberstalking. California, for example, only recently amended its stalking statute
to cover it. The amended law was used to prosecute a 50-year-old former
security guard who pleaded guilty to one count of stalking and three counts of
solicitation of sexual assault after using the Internet to solicit the rape of a
woman who rejected his romantic advances. Although general stalking statutes
in some States may cover cyberstalking, all States should review their laws to
ensure they prohibit, and provide appropriate punishment for, stalking through
the Internet and other electronic communications.

Federal Cyberstalking Laws

Federal law provides a number of important tools to combat cyberstalking.
Under 18 U.S.C. ss 875(c), it is a Federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years
in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, to transmit any communication in
interstate or foreign commerce containing a threat to injure another person.
Section 875(c) applies to any communication transmitted in interstate or foreign
commerce--including threats transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce
through telephone, e-mail, beepers, and the Internet.

Although 18 U.S.C. ss 875(c) is an important antistalking measure, it has
limited application. First, it applies only to communications of actual threats and
cannot be used in a case where a stalker engaged in a pattern of conduct
intended to harass or annoy another (absent some threat). Also, it is not clear
that it would apply to situations where a person harasses or terrorizes another
by posting messages on a bulletin board or in a chat room encouraging others
to harass or annoy another person, as in the California case.

Certain forms of cyberstalking also may be prosecuted under 47 U.S.C. ss
223. One provision of this statute makes it a Federal crime, punishable by up to
2 years in prison, to use a telephone or telecommunications device to annoy,
abuse, harass, or threaten any person at the number called.[8] The statute also
requires that the perpetrator has not revealed his or her name (see 47 U.S.C. ss
223(a)(1)(C)). Although this statute is broader than 18 U.S.C. ss 875, covering
both threats and harassment, Section 223 applies only to direct communications
between the perpetrator and the victim. It would not reach a cyberstalking
situation if a person harasses or terrorizes another person by posting messages
on a bulletin board or in a chat room encouraging others to harass or terrorize
that person. Moreover, Section 223 is only a misdemeanor, punishable by not
more than 2 years in prison.

The Interstate Stalking Act, signed into law in 1996, made it a crime for any
person to travel across State lines with the intent to injure or harass another
person and, in the course thereof, to place that person or a member of that
person's family in a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury (see 18
U.S.C. ss 2261A). 

Finally, a law was passed in October 1998 that protects children against online
stalking. The statute, 18 U.S.C. ss 2425, makes it a Federal crime to use any
means of interstate or foreign commerce (such as a telephone line or the
Internet) to communicate with any person with the intent to solicit or entice a
child into unlawful sexual activity. While this new statute provides important
protections for children, it does not reach harassing phone calls to minors
absent a showing of intent to entice or solicit the child for illicit sexual purposes.

----------------------------

First Amendment and Other Legal Considerations

All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government have
passed laws that criminalize stalking to address the serious harms and dangers
that result from stalking, including the fear of violence and loss of privacy and
control suffered by the victim. In addition to these direct harms, stalking is
frequently a precursor to physical violence against the victim. By its nature,
however, stalking is not a crime that can be defined with a particular discrete
set of acts. Frequently, stalking consists of a course of conduct that may involve
a broad range of harassing, intimidating, and threatening behavior directed at a
victim. The conduct can be as varied as the stalker's imagination and ability to
take actions that harass, threaten, and force himself or herself into the life and
consciousness of the victim. As new technologies become available, as is the
case with the Internet and cyberstalking, stalkers adapt those technologies to
new ways of stalking victims.

As a result of the breadth of conduct potentially involved in stalking, antistalking
statutes need to be relatively broad to be effective. At the same time, because
of that breadth and because stalking can involve expressive conduct and
speech, antistalking statutes must be carefully formulated and enforced so as
not to impinge on speech that is protected by the First Amendment. This is true
with regard to cyberstalking laws, which frequently involve speech over the
Internet. The Internet has been recognized as an important tool for protected
speech activities. See, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S.
844, 850-52, 870 (1997).

The fact that stalking behavior (including cyberstalking) may implicate important
issues of free speech does not eliminate the significant public interest in its
criminal regulation or suggest that all criminal regulation would be prohibited by
the freedom of speech guarantees of the First Amendment. The First
Amendment does not prohibit any and all regulations that may involve or have
an impact on speech. Of particular relevance to stalking, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recognized that governments may criminalize true threats without
violating the First Amendment. See, e.g., Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705
(1969) (per curiam). Stalking (and cyberstalking) generally involves conduct
reasonably understood to constitute a threat of violence, and such threats may
be criminalized consistent with the First Amendment. 

One of the recommendations in this chapter calls on States to review and
update their statutes to cover electronic communications in their stalking laws.
Care must be taken in drafting cyberstalking statutes to ensure that they are not
so broad that they risk chilling constitutionally protected speech, such as
political protest and other legitimate conduct. A carefully drafted statute can
provide broad protections against cyberstalking without running afoul of the
First Amendment. 

----------------------------

Federal legislation was enacted recently to fill the gaps in current law. Although
most cyberstalking cases will fall within the jurisdiction of State and local
authorities, there are instances--such as serious cyber harassment directed at a
victim in another State or involving communications intended to aid and abet
third parties in harassment or threats--where State law is inadequate, questions
of jurisdiction arise, or State and local agencies do not have the expertise or
resources to investigate and prosecute a case. (See page 41 for a description of
the Federal cyberstalking offense enacted as part of the Violence Against
Women Act of 2000.)

Recommendations

General Recommendations

o The law enforcement community, private industry, victim assistance
providers, and individuals must recognize that cyberstalking is a serious
problem--not only as a potential precursor to offline threats and violence, but
also as a serious invasion of an increasingly important aspect of people's
everyday lives. At the same time, it is important to note that many forms of
annoying and menacing activity on the Internet do not rise to the level of illegal
activity and are properly addressed by individuals and service providers without
recourse to law enforcement channels.

o The lack of comprehensive data on the nature and extent of cyberstalking
makes it difficult to develop effective response strategies. Future surveys and
research studies on stalking should, where possible, include specific information
on cyberstalking. Industry organizations can and should play a role not only in
increasing the amount of data on the cyberstalking problem but also in ensuring
that the data can be analyzed in a meaningful way.

Legislation Recommendations

o State legislators should review their existing stalking and other statutes to
determine whether they address cyberstalking and, if not, promptly expand
such laws to address cyberstalking.

o Federal law also should be amended to make it easier to track down stalkers
and other criminals in cyberspace while maintaining safeguards for privacy. In
particular, the Cable Communications Policy Act should be amended to
provide access to the same type of subscriber records, under the same
standards and privacy safeguards, as those for electronic mail subscribers under
18 U.S.C. ss 2703 (while maintaining strict limits on access to records that
reveal customer viewing habits).

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Recommendations

o Law enforcement agencies and courts need to recognize the serious nature of
cyberstalking, including the close links between offline and online stalking.

o Law enforcement agencies need training on the nature and extent of the
cyberstalking problem, including specific training on the legal tools available to
address the problem, the need for and effectiveness of prompt action by law
enforcement agencies, the most effective techniques to investigate and
prosecute cyberstalking crimes, and the resources available to cyberstalking
victims.

o Law enforcement agencies with existing stalking or computer crime units
should consider expanding the mission of such units to include cyberstalking,
and law enforcement agencies that do not have a stalking section should
consider expanding their capabilities to address both offline and online stalking.
At the least, law enforcement agencies should understand the patterns
underlying stalking in general and be prepared to respond and intercede on
behalf of cyberstalking victims.

o Law enforcement agencies should use mechanisms for quickly and reliably
sharing information about cyberstalking incidents with other law enforcement
agencies, thereby making it less likely that a cyberstalker can continue
threatening behavior simply because neither the jurisdiction of the sender nor
the jurisdiction of the victim can prosecute the offender.

o U.S. Attorneys' Offices, in consultation with other Federal, State, and local
agencies, should examine the available resources and networks of investigators
and prosecutors with the expertise to handle cyberstalking investigations. These
include violent crime specialists, computer crime investigators and prosecutors,
computer forensic specialists, and victim-witness coordinators. The Law
Enforcement Coordinating Committees, which have been established in each
USAO and are designed to foster coordination among law enforcement
agencies, would be an appropriate body for addressing these issues.

o Law enforcement agencies should work more closely with victim advocacy
groups to identify cyberstalking patterns and victim experiences and to
encourage cyberstalking victims to report incidents to law enforcement
authorities.

Industry Recommendations

o The Internet and electronic communication industry should create an
industry-supported Web site containing information about cyberstalking and
what to do if confronted with this problem. Contact information for the major
ISPs should be included so that Internet users can easily report cyberstalking
cases after visiting this centralized resource. This recommendation could be
implemented by expanding the One Click Away initiative or through a
complementary but separate initiative focused on cyberstalking.

o The industry should develop additional means to empower individuals to
protect themselves against cyberstalking. Such means might include more
accessible and effective filtering and blocking options. While some major ISPs
already allow such options, others do not.

o The industry should develop training materials to help law enforcement
investigate and prosecute cyberstalking and related crimes. For example, a
short training video could be developed to increase awareness of the
cyberstalking problem and to provide law enforcement officers with essential
information on how to work with ISPs and others in the investigation of
cyberstalking cases.

o The industry should cooperate fully with law enforcement when they are
investigating cyberstalking complaints. It can do this, for exaedical Economics
