 participant feedback that victims experience
enormous losses. The focus group cited several losses to victims that are
directly attributable to stalking: property damage and destruction, physical and
emotional injuries requiring short- and long-term medical and mental health
treatment, lost wages, expenditures related to hiding from the stalkers and
maintaining safety, and pain, suffering, and an overall reduced quality of life.

It can quickly become very costly for stalking victims to maintain safety and
health given the long-term nature of the crime and the multitude of tactics that
stalkers employ. However, the extensive financial assistance and/or resources
these victims require are simply not available in most communities. 

While many State crime compensation programs will cover some expenses
related to stalking (e.g., counseling), some States do not cover expenses unless
a violent incident has occurred. Most State programs do not cover the range of
victim expenses related to relocation, such as moving costs and lost wages.

----------------------------

As a consequence of stalking, one victim was fired from her job and forced to
declare bankruptcy.

----------------------------


The NVAW survey also addressed the cost of stalking. It reported that 26
percent of the stalking victims said their victimization caused them to lose time
from work. The survey authors attributed this lost time to the same reasons
identified by the focus group: to attend court hearings, meet with a psychologist
or other mental health professional, avoid contact with the assailant, and consult
with an attorney. Seven percent of the victims responding to the NVAW survey
said they never returned to work. For those victims who returned to work, the
average time missed due to their stalking victimization was 11 days.[18]

Professionals Who Can Help

Victims of stalking require a wide range of services from victim assistance
providers, victim advocates, justice system personnel, and other community
professionals. These service providers must:

o Validate that the stalking experienced by the victim is indeed occurring.

o Understand the complexity of the crime and the danger posed by stalkers.

o Have the capacity to provide effective intervention strategies that protect and
support victims and restrict stalkers. 

Service providers, victim advocates, and criminal justice personnel need to
provide immediate assistance to victims dealing with stalking. They must be
sensitive to the victim's need for confidentiality and ensure that information
pertaining to the victim is not released to a third party without the victim's
permission. After providing information on safety planning and resources, those
working with stalking victims need to respect and support the decisions victims
make concerning their own safety, even when they do not agree with victims'
decisions.[19]

Communities generally lack justice system personnel, victim assistance
providers, and advocates with sufficient knowledge or capacity to provide
specialized assistance for stalking victims, particularly for those who are being
stalked by strangers or acquaintances or through the Internet. The focus group
reported that other community professionals, such as doctors, mental health
providers, welfare and child protection workers, daycare providers, school
staff, employers, and church leaders, also lack knowledge about how to identify
and respond to stalking.

Response Tailored to Individual Circumstances

Victim experiences vary due to multiple factors, which must be taken into
account when developing effective responses to promote victim safety and
restrict the actions of stalkers. Specifically, victims emphasized that it is
important not to evaluate the stalker's behavior based on the victim's
relationship with the stalker. Instead, those working with stalking victims should
incorporate prior knowledge of each particular stalker with studied behavior
patterns of stalkers in general to develop a proper response. Because stalking
behavior is unpredictable, mechanisms must be in place to protect victims if and
when stalking escalates.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Individualized Response

In 1996, the Victim Services Stalking Unit of the Queens, New York, Criminal
Court Program received funding from the New York Crime Victims Board to
provide services to stalking victims, regardless of whether the victim was
physically injured in the course of the stalking crimes. The unit offers stalking
victims crisis intervention and emotional support, assistance with assessing risk
and safety planning, defense kits, instruction on keeping logs of evidence for
court, and legal advocacy and case management throughout the criminal justice
system. It also offers victims fact sheets, brochures, and tip cards, written in
both English and Spanish. For more information, call 718-286-6084 (Kew
Gardens, NY).

----------------------------

Many communities have justice system and victim assistance resources set up
to help domestic violence victims assess their risk of danger and plan for safety.
These resources may or may not be sufficient to help victims who are stalked
by partners or former partners. 

Underserved Populations of Victims

Stalking victims may face further obstacles to getting help because their
communities are not prepared to provide the individualized attention and
services they need, due to factors such as: 

o Physical, cognitive, or emotional disabilities.

o Language capacity. 

o Cultural and ethnic background.


o Socioeconomic status.

o Place of residence, such as a rural area or college campus.

o Gender.

o Sexual orientation.

o Immigration status.

o Religion.

o Race.

Agencies need specific training and technology to assist these victims
successfully. For example, victims with hearing disabilities need to be able to
communicate with others to get help. Assisting agencies should have TTY/TDD
machines and the capacity to use them, know how to use phone relay systems,
and have quick access to sign-language interpreters. Victims with a wide range
of experiences, resources, or capabilities need individuals with appropriate
sensitivities and cultural backgrounds to advocate for them, particularly in
interactions with agencies not equipped to deal with victims from diverse
communities.

Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

Focus group participants recounted several types of criminal justice
interventions that may be effective in maintaining victim safety and holding
offenders accountable. They include:

o Swift and timely law enforcement response.

o Dispatchers who address victim safety first and officers who make every
attempt to arrest stalkers.

o Investigation of each case thoroughly and aggressively with the goal of
charging stalkers with the fullest range of crimes possible.  

o Assistance for victims in assessing stalkers' potential lethality and developing
safety plans.

o Instruction for victims on how to document stalking activities and use
equipment to collect evidence such as an answering machine, tape recorder,
camera, or video camera.

o Helping victims obtain restraining orders or referring victims to advocates
who can assist them in obtaining restraining orders and a quick response to any
violations of these orders. 

o Aggressive prosecution and court responses that keep stalkers away from
victims after charges are filed, such as high bonds that may help keep stalkers
incarcerated before or during trials, or requests that no contact be a condition
of pretrial release.

o Providing victims with information about stalking crimes, legal remedies, and
referrals to community resources.

o Helping victims keep personal information confidential throughout criminal
justice proceedings (e.g., a stalker's attorney should not be able to obtain
information that the stalker can use to threaten or harass the victim). 

o Proactive prosecution and court responses that involve effective strategies to
deter stalkers from further acts of stalking and to protect victims, such as the
electronic monitoring of stalkers as part of sentencing. 

o Notifying victims of stalkers' pending release from correctional or mental
facilities and the conditions of their probation, along with assistance in
post-release safety planning and protection.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

The Dover, New Hampshire, Police Department recently received an Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant to establish an
antistalking unit and develop antistalking countermeasures. The
countermeasures will comprise the following: vertical investigation and
prosecution, streamlined investigation methods and use of technology to
enhance investigations, use of global positioning satellite technology to monitor
offenders, and development of victim safety strategies, including assistance with
relocation. To coordinate victim relocation, the unit will partner with one or
more agencies to help victims maintain safety during transitions to their new
locations. For more information, call 603-743-6140.

----------------------------


Some justice agencies and professionals have developed creative strategies to
combat stalking and help victims maintain their safety. However, many criminal
justice agencies lack the capacity to provide the comprehensive protection
needed by stalking victims, often due to a lack of effective antistalking laws or
agency protocols addressing stalking. There is also a general lack of
understanding about the seriousness of the issue. Gaps in responses, such as
incorrectly charging stalking crimes and failing to enforce restraining orders
against stalkers, can result in increased danger for victims.

Other barriers to effective criminal justice system intervention include stalker
manipulation of the justice system and heavy evidence collection burdens on
victims. For example, some stalkers successfully shift attention away from
themselves by claiming that victims are stalking them or by accusing victims of
child abuse or neglect. At the same time, they continue to stalk the victims.
Moreover, realizing their cases will not go forward in the criminal justice system
without sufficient evidence, many victims spend a lot of time and energy keeping
detailed logs of stalking incidents and collecting supporting documentation. In
fact, in order to obtain evidence that the crime of stalking has been committed,
victims often have to endure more stalking acts.

----------------------------

One participant said that stalking is one of the few crimes where victims who
want their cases to go forward are cast as their own investigators and required
to do things that professionals usually do.

----------------------------

In order to pursue justice system remedies, stalking victims often meet with
investigators and prosecutors, gather evidence, fill out paperwork, petition the
court for protection orders, and testify against stalkers. They may have to miss
work and lose wages, provide for childcare, and find transportation. Not only
does justice system involvement often present financial and logistical problems
for victims, it also may increase the danger they face. Stalkers may try to make
contact with victims as they travel to and from government buildings. Many
victims view incarceration of their stalker as a temporary reprieve and are
consumed by fear of their offenders' pending release. For some victims,
however, even incarceration fails to end the violence; their stalkers continue to
terrorize them from prisons or mental institutions by sending them threatening
letters. 

Assistance and Advocacy for All Victims


Although it is imperative that the criminal justice system provide stalking victims
with support, information, and advocacy throughout criminal proceedings,
victims also need nonlegal resources and assistance to maintain their safety,
such as: 

o Confidential emergency shelter for victims who are in immediate danger. 

o Crime-specific crisis intervention and support for victims, family, and friends.

o Assistance in cutting off stalkers' access to information about victims.

o Access to safety-enhancing equipment such as cell phones and body alarms.

o Help in protecting children and other dependents from stalkers, including
representation in family courts to revoke stalkers' custody rights. 

As long as they feel any risk, victims need ongoing advocacy and assistance
with planning for their safety, as well as access to resources to implement their
plans. Some victims may feel so endangered that they are compelled to make
significant changes to hide from their stalkers, such as altering their identity or
relocating to another area, and will need comprehensive assistance similar to
that provided through witness protection programs.

Chapter 4
State Stalking Legislation Update--1998, 1999, and 2000 Sessions

States have enacted stalking legislation increasingly in each of the past 3 years.
In part, this reflects a growing understanding of the impact of stalking behavior.
New legislative topics are being addressed today that were not foreseeable
when legislators first addressed stalking crimes 10 years ago. The 3-year
review below summarizes stalking legislation from 1998 to 2000. It does not
include final information from about 12 legislatures that were still in session
when this review was completed in August 2000.

In 1998, the 44 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 150 new laws directed at violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 11 States passed laws amending their stalking and related criminal
laws, including 2 States that passed new stalking injunction laws (see table 1).
In 1999, the 49 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 300 laws relating to violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 26 States passed laws related to stalking (see table 2). By August
2000, 20 of the 44 State legislatures in session had enacted 27 stalking related
laws (see table 3). Overall, fewer than 200 enactments in the 2000 legislative
year addressed violence against women issues.[20]

Many other laws directed at helping victims of domestic violence also may
apply when stalking behavior is related to domestic violence. For example, laws
requiring that a jurisdiction give full faith and credit to other jurisdictions'
protection orders may apply either to orders prohibiting stalking as an element
of domestic violence or to antistalking orders. Similarly, laws providing
confidentiality for victims of domestic violence may be used by stalking victims
when the stalker is a current or former intimate partner under the State
domestic violence law. Hence, this list of new laws is not all inclusive.

The new laws explicitly directed at stalking behavior primarily change either the
definition of or the penalty for stalking or authorize courts to issue antistalking
protection orders. Other new laws authorize arrest of misdemeanor stalkers
and prohibit firearm possession when an antistalking order has been issued. 

Stalking and Related Cases: 1990-2000

Challenges to State Antistalking Laws

Although it has been only 10 years since the first stalking law was enacted, the
passage of these laws in all 50 States has sparked considerable litigation over
their constitutionality and scope. In reviewing and interpreting stalking laws,
courts often have drawn on cases involving similar penal statutes--those
criminalizing harassment and those involving threats.[21] These laws not only
deal with related behavior, but they also use the kind of terms and phrases
(e.g., annoy, repeatedly) that may be the subject of legal attack by defendants.
Thus, analysis of stalking laws must examine all three types of criminal laws and
statutes covering threats and harassment by telephone.

This review identified 464 State and 17 Federal stalking and related cases in
which challenges to antistalking and related laws were addressed.[22] Among
these were a total of 157 stalking cases, including 2 Federal cases. The stalking
cases involved predominantly constitutional challenges (124 cases in 34 States
and the District of Columbia), typically based on vagueness, overbreadth, and
related First Amendment issues. The review also looked at the relationship
between the stalker and the victim in cases in which the relevant statutes were
challenged. This review found that 56 of the 129 stalking cases for which
relationship information was available involved nonintimate partners. This
category included 14 cases involving stranger stalking; the other nonpartner
cases covered relationships such as neighbors, ex-employees,
psychiatrist-patient, judge-litigant, and landlord-tenant. In 38 cases, the
perpetrator had a dating relationship with the victim, including several in which
the perpetrator cohabited with the victim. In many states, stalking against a
former dating partner can be classified as domestic violence for the purpose of
obtaining a court order of protection. In 35 cases, the perpetrators stalked
former wives from whom they were divorced or separated. Almost all of the
reported cases in which statutes were challenged involved male stalkers.

----------------------------

Among the stalking-related cases, 56 involved harassment and 100 involved
threats. These cases were selected for review because they involved either an
important legal question with implications for interpretation of the stalking law at
issue or a situation similar to stalking in which questions of sufficiency of the
evidence affected the court decision. In 41 of the harassment cases and 36 of
the threat cases, the defendant raised constitutional challenges. There were 43
harassment and 64 threat cases involving statutory construction issues. Many of
the 56 harassment cases raised constitutional and statutory construction issues.

Other types of cases covered by this review included 20 telephone threat
cases, 85 telephone harassment cases, 8 letter threat or harassment cases, and
6 electronic threat or harassment cases. In addition, 47 cases involved
protection orders, typically stalking charges related to violation of a protection
order. Three cases involved civil suits for damages based on civil stalking laws
or some other invasion of privacy. Among these cases were 87 constitutional
law decisions and 51 statutory construction decisions. There were also five
cases in which defendants raised jurisdictional or other constitutional challenges
to Federal laws.

The list of cases in appendix A does not necessarily include all relevant
reported cases, although a significant effort was made to identify such
cases.[23] The review excluded reported decisions that involved solely
evidentiary issues where no constitutional or statutory interpretation issues were
decided.[24] Threat and harassment cases that were totally unrepresentative of
stalking concerns also were excluded, while included, for example, were threats
and verbal abuse of police officers.[25] 

In general, court decisions reviewed here measured constitutional challenges
based on overbreadth by whether the law prohibits acts rather than speech and
by whether it contains an intent to cause a specified harm. Vagueness claims
generally were evaluated based on whether the harmful acts barred by the law
are of such specificity that an ordinary person would not fail to understand what
is prohibited. Therefore, statutes that criminalize acts that include an intent to
cause harm as an element of the offense were most likely to pass constitutional
muster. This finding is consistent with the precepts underlying the Model
Anti-Stalking Code,[26] which limits its scope to acts that create a fear of
serious injury and include an intent component. 

The review in appendix A identifies each case by the name of the litigants, type
of law involved, and case citation and gives a brief summary of the court's
decision. Court rulings apply only to the specific statutory language used in the
case before the court. Thus, while there may be general agreement among the
courts within a State on a particular legal issue, such an agreement may not be
relevant to the language used in a particular State statute. With this important
caveat, review of the cases suggests the following:

1. Most stalking statutes meet constitutional minimums. Inclusion of an intent
requirement resolves most vagueness challenges. However, the use of terms
such as "annoy" or "alarm" without limiting definitions makes a law vulnerable to
challenge on the basis that it is unconstitutionally vague. Statutes have been
upheld that establish a rebuttable presumption of intent where there is evidence
that the victim requested that the stalking conduct end. Most statutes require
that the prohibited acts include a threat component, that the defendant intend to
cause or know of the victim's fear of death or serious injury and that the victim's
fear be reasonable.

2.  A finding of contempt for a violation of a protection order does not
generally prevent a second prosecution for the substantive stalking offense on
double jeopardy grounds. Some courts may require, however, that the acts
constituting stalking be different from those underlying the charge of violating the
order. There is no agreement among the courts that evidence of a prior
restraining order may be admitted to show the defendant's intent or course of
action, but a prior order may be used to show victim fear. Courts differ on
whether a collateral attack may be permitted on the validity of a court order in
protection order violation proceedings.


3. Harassment laws are vulnerable to a constitutional challenge where the
prohibited speech is not limited to "fighting words." "Fighting words" refers to
language that is likely to lead to a physical confrontation. Such language is
entitled to less protection under the First Amendment.

4. It is permissible for threat laws that include a reasonable fear requirement to
equate reckless behavior by the perpetrator with intent to cause reasonable fear
for the victim. In some States, actual terror is not required, merely that fear
would be reasonable under the circumstances and that there is an intent to
terrorize. An intent to carry out the threat is not an element of the crime, and
physical acts alone may constitute a threat. The absence in most States of
statutory language defining stalking to include implied threats is made even more
significant by the lack of court rulings in many of these same States interpreting
threat laws to include implied or conditional threats.

5. Harassment and threat laws apply to communications delivered through
third parties where such delivery may be reasonably anticipated or intended.

6. Telephone harassment and threat laws usually focus on the intent of the
caller, not the response of the person called, because invasion of privacy is an
implicit second element of the crime. Intent must be complemented by proof of
harassment or threatening acts. A law barring intent alone without regard to the
actual contents of the communication will be overbroad. A few courts do,
however, require that victim fear result from a telephone threat, depending on
the specific language of the statute involved. Courts also are split on whether
harassing intent must be the sole purpose of the communication or may coexist
with legitimate motives for the communication.

7. Prosecution of electronic harassment by fax, Internet, citizen band radio, or
other means may require specific statutory language prohibiting the use of these
medias to harass.

8. Jurisdiction or venue lies in the locality or State where a non-face-to-face
threat or harassment communication is received. Jurisdiction also may lie in the
location from which the communication was sent.

9. Intrastate communication that involves interstate intermediaries to deliver
the message confers Federal jurisdiction over the crime where a Federal statute
applies to the conduct.

In the first 10 years since stalking has been criminalized, most courts have
recognized the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting citizens against
stalking. Accordingly, courts generally have affirmed the constitutionality of
antistalking legislation when weighed against First Amendment concerns.


However, a number of courts have struck down related laws that lack specific
fighting words requirements to narrow their scope. Courts also are beginning to
accommodate legal complications often resulting from the repetitive nature of
the stalking crime, in some cases allowing separate prosecutions for protection
order violations and substantive offenses. However, there is no broad
agreement across jurisdictions that these offenses may be tried separately
without raising double jeopardy concerns.

Unfortunately, at least two major gaps remain in States' legislative initiatives
against stalking and their interpretations by the courts. State legislatures and
courts frequently fail to recognize implied or conditional threats in their
construction of the stalking crime. Stalkers who follow, repeatedly contact, and
otherwise terrorize their victims in a persistent and even obsessive manner may
slip through the cracks of the criminal justice system if they refrain from spelling
out their threats. Such legislative loopholes need to be addressed.

In addition, current stalking legislation lacks explicit bars to harassment via
electronic media such as telephones, fax machines, e-mail, and the Internet. By
and large, courts are not interpreting older legislation to cover recently
developed communications technologies. Such narrow interpretation of
antistalking codes does not cover cyberstalking and other modes of high-tech
terrorization. Thus, many States may need to enact specific legislative bans on
the use of such media for stalking purposes. When use of these communications
technologies crosses State lines, however, courts have agreed that Federal
jurisdiction is conferred. To date, prosecution under Federal laws may have
been more successful than State prosecution in bringing high-tech stalkers to 
justice.

Appendix A summarizes the status of State cases filed through August 2000.

Chapter 5 
Federal Prosecutions

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) made it a Federal offense
to cross State or tribal lines to commit domestic violence or to violate a
protection order.[27] It is also a Federal offense to possess a firearm while
under a domestic violence protection order or if convicted of a misdemeanor
crime of domestic violence.[28] Although the vast majority of domestic violence
cases continue to be prosecuted at the State, local, and tribal levels, these
statutory tools enable Federal law enforcement to prosecute certain cases in
cooperation with the local authorities.

A Federal interstate stalking law, 18 U.S.C. ss 2261A, was enacted in 1996.
This statute prohibited individuals from traveling across a State line with the
intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of or as a result of
that travel, placing that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious
bodily injury to, that person or a member of that person's immediate family. The
statute also criminalized the same conduct within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States regardless of whether a State line was
crossed. Courts may sentence offenders to 10 years if the offense results in
serious bodily injury to the victim or if the offender uses a dangerous weapon,
20 years if permanent disfigurement or life-threatening bodily injury results, and
a life sentence if death of the victim results.

The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (VAWA 2000) amended the
Federal interstate stalking law to include travel across State and national
boundaries, as well as travel into or out of Indian country and within the special
maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.[29] VAWA 2000 also
expanded the Federal statute to cover certain travel or conduct with the intent
to kill, i
