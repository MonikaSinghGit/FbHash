theastern part of the Territory, adjoining Brilish Columbia, is one of the largest counties. Very little of its area has been surveyed, and it is quite sparsely settled, the population in 1880 being only 1,245. Value of taxable property, in 1881, $164,719; assessed acreage, 2,720. Its surface is that of a great rolling plateau, having many deep valleys, called coul6es, the channels of former water courses, with soil of the best sort for grain and grass. The country is well watered by countless streams, and is free from alkali. There are growths of good timber, consisting of spruce, white pine and large tamarack throughout the region, interspersed with open arable land, which produces good crops of wheat and vegetables, as well as melons and tomatoes, wherever it has been tried. The immense Colville country offers the very best inducements to settlers, and attention is directed to it. The climate is warmer than that of the Walla Walla Valley. Gold is found in the streams north of the Spokane River, and the mountainous region toward Lake Pend d'Oreille is rich in ledges of fine white and variegated marble, limestone and granite, as well as gold-bearing quartz. Horses in large droves are wintered in this county without care, subsisting on the bunch-grass. Colville is the county seat. At Kettle Falls (old Fort Colville) there is good salmon fishing, and game of all kinds is everywhere abundant.
