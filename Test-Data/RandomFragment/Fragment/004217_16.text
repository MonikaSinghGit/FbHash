r such as Hydra A 
contains hundreds of galaxies and enough gaseous material to make 
a thousand more galaxies.  One intriguing question has been the 
ultimate fate of this colossal gas reservoir.   Early X-ray 
observations indicated that the gas in the inner regions of Hydra 
A should be cooling and slowly settling into the center of the 
cluster to form new galaxies or hundreds of trillions of dim 
stars.  As astronomers began searching for this cool matter, they 
were puzzled to find that the new galaxies and stars were not 
detected in sufficient numbers.
