recess." The transcript reveals thatrespondents and their counsel were present in the courtroom at thattime (Tr. 100).   A transcript of the in-chambers conference, which is reprinted infull at App., infra, 19a-22a, was prepared and made available to allparties.  App., infra, 5a.  Respondent Gagnon's attorney was presentand participated in questioning the juror.  None of the otherattorneys for the defendants or the government requested to be presentor attended;  nor did any of the defendants request to be personallypresent.  /13/   At the conference, the trial judge explained to juror Graham thatGagnon is an "artist" and that the sketching was "just one of thosethings that happened.  The Court has stopped it.  It won't continue."App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 189-190.  She then asked the juror whether theincident would "affect you in any way." App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 190.The juror responded (ibid.):      As far as any judgment on what's going on, it doesn't affect me.       I just thought that perhaps because of the seriousness of the      trial, and because of -- whichever way the deliberations go, it      kind of -- it upset me, because -- of what could happen      afterwards.The judge then inquired whether "it upset you to the extent that youcouldn't judge Mr. Gagnon fairly." The juror responded, "No." Thejudge pursued the matter, and juror Graham repeatedly avowed that hecould be fair to everyone concerned.  Ibid.   Graham informed the judge and defense counsel that one other jurorhad mentioned that he had noticed Gagnon's sketching, but that thejuror "didn't know what it was." App., infra, 20a;  Tr. 191.  No otherjurors had mentioned observing the incident.  App., infra, 21a;  Tr.191.   At this juncture, the trial judge asked Gagnon's attorney whetherhe was "satisf(ied)" with the results of the interview.  The attorneyposed two questions to juror Graham:  whether his conversation withthe bailiff had taken place in front of other jurors, and whether theincident would "prejudice you in any way against Mr. Gagnon." Grahamassured the attorney that the conversation with the bailiff was in thehallway, away from the other jurors, and that he would not beprejudiced against Gagnon.  App., infra, 21a;  Tr. 191-192.   On the basis of this interview, the trial judge concluded not todismiss the juror;  she instructed him not to discuss anything aboutthe matter with the other jurors.  She then asked defense counselwhether the outcome of the conference was "agreeable with you." App.,infra, 21a-22a;  Tr. 192.  Gagnon's attorney replied, "Yes," and theconference was completed.  Ibid.  Neither then nor at any other timedid any of the attorneys for respondents move to disqualify jurorGraham or the other juror who witnessed the sketching.  Nor was anyobjection made to conducting the conference in the absence of thedefendants.   3. The court of appeals reversed the convictions on the ground(App., infra, 6a-7a) that respondents' right "to be present duringcommunications between the judge and the jury," grounded in theConstitution, principles of jury trial, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 43, wasviolated by the conference with juror Graham.  The court held thatrespondents had not waived their right to be present at the conferenceby their failure to ask to attend.  Insofar as that right isconstitutionally based, the court held that the standard for waiver isthe "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right orprivilege" test of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938) -- astandard the court held was not satisfied here.  App., infra, 11a.   The court of appeals rejected the government's argument thatrespondents, having failed to object to the conference at trial, couldnot raise the issue on appeal.  Although invoking the "plain error"exception of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), the court made no finding thatthe procedure followed by the trial court had "affect(ed) substantialrights" of the accused, as Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) requires.  Itconcluded instead that "(a) criminal defendant's right to be presentat every stage of his trial is so fundamental that, in certaincircumstances, its violation must be noticed by a reviewing courtregardless of a failure to raise the issue below." App., infra, 11an.2(citing Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 41 (1975)).   Finally, the court of appeals found that the infringement ofrespondents' personal right to be present at the conference was notharmless beyond a reasonable doubt, on the ground that "(t)he presenceof the defendants was necessary in order to safeguard anotherconstitutional right -- the right to an impartial jury" (App., infra,13a).  While "unable to say on this record that the right to animpartial jury was infringed," the court found that it could not "saywith assurance that the absence was harmless." Id. at 13a-14a.   Judge Skopil dissented (App., infra, 14a-15a).  He would have heldthat respondents' interests were adequately represented by Gagnon'scounsel, and that the conference with the juror thus constitutedharmless error.  "It is difficult to conceive of any value from thepresence of defendants and the remaining defense attorneys.  Theirquestions would have been mere surplusage to those posed by (Gagnon'sattorney) and the court." Ibid.  Indeed, Judge Skopil stated, "(t)headded presence of the defendants and their counsel would have been * ** quite possibly detrimental to their interest." Id. at 15a.                   REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION   This Court and the courts of appeals have frequently been calledupon to address the consequences of communications between trial judgeand juror outside the presence of the defendant.  /14/ This is becausesuch communications, formal or informal, are common and oftenunavoidable.  As this Court recently noted, "(t)here is scarcely alengthy trial in which one or more jurors does not have occasion tospeak to the trial judge about something, whether it relates to amatter of personal comfort or to some aspect of the trial." Rushen v.Spain, No. 82-2083 (Dec. 12, 1983), slip op. 4.  It is important thatrules of appellate review in this area accommodate the exigencies oftrial practice as well as protect the substantial rights of theaccused.  An approach to these issues that "ignores the() day-to-dayrealities of courtroom life" will, as this Court observed,"undermine() society's interest in the administration of criminaljustice." Id. at 4-5.   This case involves a particularly innocuous form of conferencebetween judge and juror -- one in which defense counsel activelyparticipates and the conference is transcribed for the record.  Thecontrast between the reasonableness of the procedure and the sweepingand unrealistic terms of the decision below is, therefore, striking.The court of appeals held that any communication between judge andjuror in the absence of the defendant -- even if defense counsel ispresent and participates -- is in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 43 andthe Constitution unless the defendant has, in advance, specificallyindicated his "willingness to be absent" (App., infra, 10a);  thecourt also held that the potential effects of such a communication areinherently so serious that an appellate court is required to reverseeven when the defendant failed to lodge an objection at trial andthere is no finding of specific prejudice to the defense.   The decision below is in conflict with decisions of this Court andnumerous courts of appeals.  It establishes so capricious a standardas to invite -- even require -- needless reversals in scores ofcriminal cases where defense counsel (but not the defendant) has fullyparticipated in all phases of trial, where the defendant has neitherrequested to be present at nor objected to the results of conferencesbetween judge and juror, and where there is no conceivable prejudicialimpact on the outcome of the trial.  It has distorted the requirementsof Fed. R. Crim. P. 43 and the Constitution and has virtuallyeliminated the requirement for a timely objection.  We submit that thedecision warrants review by this Court.   1. a. In Rushen v. Spain, supra, this Court left open the questionwhether a criminal defendant's constitutional right to be present attrial was violated when the trial court, with no notice to counsel andin the absence of both counsel and defendant, questioned a juror aboutthe possibility of prejudice.  Slip op. 3-4 n.2.  In a concurringopinion, Justice Stevens commented (slip op. 4):         I think it quite clear that the mere occurrence of an ex      parte conversation between a trial judge and a juror does not      constitute a deprivation of any constitutional right.  The      defense has no constitutional right to be present at every      interaction between a judge and a juror, nor is there a      constitutional right to have a court reporter transcribe every      such communication.This case presents the question whether an in-chambers conferencebetween trial judge and juror on the possibility of prejudice,conducted on the record and with full participation by defensecounsel, violates a defendant's constitutional rights.  We submit itdoes not.  It also presents the parallel question under Fed. R. Crim.P. 43.   As the court of appeals recognized (App., infra, 5a-6a), the rightto be present at trial has two sources in the Constitution, theConfrontation Clause and the Due Process Clause.  The former obviouslyhas no application to this case since a conference between judge andjuror does not implicate the defendant's right "to be confronted withthe witnesses against him." U.S. Const. Amend. VI;  Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 107 (1934);  see Rushen v. Spain, slip op.8 n.8 (Stevens, J., concurring);  Polizzi v. United States, 550 F.2d1133, 1138 (9th Cir. 1976).   The due process right to be present is more complicated.  As thecourt of appeals recognized (App., infra, 7a), the right "is notabsolute." This Court formulated the right in Snyder, 291 U.S. at105-106, as follows:  "the defendant has the privilege under theFourteenth Amendment to be present in his own person whenever hispresence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of hisopportunity to defend again
