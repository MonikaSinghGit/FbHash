PATTERN EXPECTED OVER NORTH AMERICA FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD.  MOST MODELS 
SUGGEST THAT A TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL DEEPEN THROUGH THE PERIOD 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AND AMPLITUDE OF THE 
TROUGH DEVELOPMENT.  BOTH THE 0Z ECMWF AND 6Z GFS HIGH RESOLUTION RUNS HOLD ON 
TO AN EAST COAST RIDGE AND KEEP THE MEAN TROUGH AXIS IN THE CENTRAL CONUS...

AXIS BETWEEN THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THE 
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL CONSENSUS IN PREDICTING A RIDGE OVER THE WEST COAST AND A 
TROUGH EXTENDING FROM WESTERN ALASKA SOUTHWARD INTO THE NORTH PACIFIC.  THE 
UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY BETWEEN THE START AND END OF THE 
6 TO 10 DAY PERIOD... AND TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE 
NORMAL OVER MUCH OF THE EAST AT THE START OF THE PERIOD... SO 5-DAY MEAN
