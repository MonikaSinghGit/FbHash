F ALASKA UNDER THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH... ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
CONFLICTING INDICATIONS AMONG THE TOOLS.  WET CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE 
ALASKAN PANHANDLE AS THE MAIN PACIFIC STORM TRACK IS DEFLECTED NORTHWARD INTO 
THE REGION OVER THE BUILDING RIDGE OVER WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.  

TODAYS OFFICIAL 500-HPA BLEND CONSISTS OF 10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 0Z 
GFS CENTERED ON DAY 8...10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 6Z GFS CENTERED ON 
DAY 8...50 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL ECMWF CENTERED ON DAY 7...AND 30 
PERCENT OF TODAY'S GFS SUPERENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 8.

MODEL(S) OF THE DAY: 0Z ECMWF ENSEMBLE MEAN. 

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD IS BELOW AVERAGE... 2 ON A SCALE OF 
1 TO 5... DUE TO AN EXPECTED TRANSITION IN UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION REGIMES 
WITHIN THE PERIOD.

THE 6-10 DAY TEMPERATURE PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
REFORECAST TEMPERATURE TOOL...  ANALOGS FROM THE VARIOUS MODELS... AND THE 
NORTH AMERICAN ENSEMBLE FORECAST SYSTEM TEMPERATURE OUTLOOK.  

THE 6-10 DAY PRECIPITATION PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
PRECIPITATION TOOL...  ANALOG AND NEURAL NET SPECIFICATIONS FROM THE OFFICIAL 
BLENDED HEIGHT FIELD

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 23 - 29 2007:

THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION PATTERN EXPECTED IN THE 
8 TO 14 DAY PERIOD.  A TROUGH IS EXPECTED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WITH A RIDGE 
OVER WESTERN PORTIONS OF NORTH AMERICA.  BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED IN 
THE WEST.  WITH THE PACIFIC JET DEFLECTED NORTHWARD OVER THE WESTERN RIDGE... 
BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY... 
EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS OF THE ALASKAN SOUTH COAST AND THE PANHANDLE WHERE THE 
PACIFIC STORM TRACK SHOULD FAVOR WET CONDITIONS... AND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST 
EXTENDING INTO THE GREAT LAKES WHICH WILL BE NEAR OR AHEAD OF THE EASTERN 
TROUGH.  THE RIDGE BUILDS INTO EASTERN ALASKA WITHIN THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD... SO 
TEMPERATURES IN EASTERN ALASKA AND THE PANHANDLE SHOULD MODERATE CONSIDERABLY 
BETWEEN THE 6 TO 10 AND 8 TO 14 DAY PERIOD. 

THE OFFICIAL 8-14 DAY HEIGHT PROG CONSISTS OF 10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 
0Z GFS CENTERED ON DAY 11...10 PERCENT OF TODAY'S OPERATIONAL 6Z GFS CENTERED 
ON DAY 11...20 PERCENT OF TODAY'S 0Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11...20 
PERCENT OF TODAY'S 6Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11...AND 40 PERCENT OF 
TODAY'S GFS SUPERENSEMBLE MEAN CENTERED ON DAY 11.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD IS ABOVE AVERAGE... 4 ON A SCALE OF 
1 TO 5.

THE 8-14 DAY TEMPERATURE PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
REFORECAST TEMPERATURE TOOL...  ANALOG... KLEIN SPECIFICATIONS FROM THE 
OFFICIAL BLENDED HEIGHT FIELD... AND THE NORTH AMERICAN FORECAST SYSTEM 
TEMPERATURE OUTLOOK.

THE 8-14 DAY PRECIPITATION PROG IS BASED ON THE CPC AUTO FORECAST... THE CDC 
PRECIPITATION TOOL...  ANALOG AND NEURAL NET SPECIFICATIONS FROM THE OFFICIAL 
BLENDED HEIGHT FIELD... AND CALIBRATED PRECIPITATION FROM THE VARIOUS MODELS.

NOTES: 

OPERATIONAL CHANGE: AS OF JULY 5 2005 SHADED MAPS HAVE REPLACED THE 
CONTOUR-ONLY MAPS ON THE CPC WEB SITE. THE CONTOURED MAPS ARE 
STILL AVAILABLE AT THEIR CURRENT FILE NAMES - SO DIRECT-LINKED USERS 
ARE NOT AFFECTED. AWIPS GRAPHICS ARE ALSO NOT AFFECTED BY THIS 
CHANGE.

AUTOMATED FORECASTS ARE ISSUED ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  OTHERWISE -
FORECASTS INCORPORATE FORECASTER INPUT.

THE NOTATION FOR THE CATEGORICAL FORECAST INDICATED ON THE MAPS IS
THE SAME AS THAT IN THE TABLES: A-ABOVE   N-NEAR NORMAL   B-BELOW

IN THE SOUTHWEST AND OTHER CLIMATOLOGICALLY DRY REGIONS - THERE WILL
BE A GREATER THAN 33.3% CHANCE OF NO PRECIPITATION AND OCCASIONALLY
EVEN A NORMAL (I.E. MEDIAN) VALUE OF ZERO - ESPECIALLY DURING THE DRY
SEASONS.  IN SUCH CASES A FORECAST OF NEAR NORMAL IS EFFECTIVELY A
FORECAST OF LITTLE OR NO PRECIPITATION.

THE NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FORECAST PATTERNS FOR TEMPERATURE
AND PRECIPITATION FOR BOTH THE 6-10 OR 8-14 DAY PERIODS HAS BEEN
DISCONTINUED.  THE STATE TABLES FOR BOTH THE 6-10 AND 8-14 DAY
PERIODS ARE NOW CONTAINED IN THIS MESSAGE...AVAILABLE AS PMDMRD ON
AWIPS. 

THE CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER USES 1971-2000 BASE PERIOD MEANS FOR 
TEMPERATURE...PRECIPITATION...AND 500-HPA HEIGHTS AS REFERENCE IN 
THE CLIMATE OUTLOOKS.


THE NEXT SET OF LONG-LEAD MONTHLY AND SEASONAL OUTLOOKS WILL BE RELEASED ON 
OCTOBER 18.  

NEW NOTE EFFECTIVE MAR 16 2004:
THE GLOSSARY FORMERLY FOUND AT THIS LOCATION WILL NO LONGER BE
