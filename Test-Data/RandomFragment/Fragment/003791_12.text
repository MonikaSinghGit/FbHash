DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD

                                   May 23, 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR:     G.W. Cunningham, Technical Director

COPIES:             Board Members

FROM:               Matthew B. Moury, Pantex Program Manager

SUBJECT:            Pantex Site - DNFSB Staff  Report - Conduct of Operations and
                    Training and Qualification Program Review.


1.   Purpose:  This memorandum documents the results of a review of conduct of operations and
     training and qualification programs at Pantex.  Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (Board)
     staff members J. DeLoach, T. Dwyer, M. Moury, and H. Waugh, and outside expert 
  D. Volgenau conducted the review during the period April 19-21, 1995.  Board Member Mr.
  J.W. Crawford, Jr. participated on one day of the review.

2.   Summary:   The training and qualification  programs and the implementation of conduct of
     operations at Mason and Hanger-Silas Mason Company (M&H) and the Department of
Energy
     (DOE) Amarillo Area Office (AAO) were reviewed.  This review was accomplished through
     discussions with responsible managers, reviews of directives and records, attendance at
scheduled
     field meetings, observation of work practices in the field, and interviews with managers,
     supervisors, engineers, and operators.  The following summarizes the major observations from
     the visit.

  a. Except for the Facility Representative (FR) program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H
     in implementing conduct of operations and an effective training and qualification program.
     Progress in the training area appears to be hindered by a lack of senior DOE-AAO
     management attention, compounded by a lack of cooperation between the DOE Albuquerque
     Operations Office (DOE-AL) and DOE-AAO.

  b. M&H has made good progress in formulating a sound training and qualification program. 
     Not all of the elements of this program have been formalized, however, and for those
     formalized and implemented, there are decided differences in the quality of program
     implementation between divisions.  An effective self-assessment system is not fully-
     implemented and a fundamentals training program has only been conceptualized.  A system
     that effectively tracks the qualification and training status of each M&H individual has been
     developed.

  c. Many procedures and directives have been developed to assist in implementing conduct of
     operations principles and to satisfy the requirements of the Pantex Plant Conduct of
     Operations Action Plan (COOAP).  Although progress has been made, the effectiveness of
     the implementation is uneven across the site.  Currently, the program appears to emphasize
     satisfying the near-term COOAP requirements rather than generating a true understanding of
     conduct of operations principles in managers, supervisors, and operators and ensuring
     continued long-term improvement in the formality of operations at Pantex. 
     
3.   Background: Staff reviews in 1993 resulted in formal Board reporting requirements on
training
     and qualification, forwarded July 6, 1993, and conduct of operations, forwarded November 4,
     1993.  The DOE responses to the Board's letters included corrective action plans to address
the
     deficiencies with the programs.  This review was a follow-up to assess the progress made in
     implementing DOE Order 5480.19, Conduct of Operations Requirements for DOE Facilities
and
     DOE Order 5480.20A, Personnel Selection, Qualification, and Training Requirements for
DOE
     Nuclear Facilities.

4.   Discussion: 

  a. DOE-AAO Training and Staffing

     1.   Except for the FR program, DOE-AAO is significantly behind M&H in  implementing a
          sound training and qualification program.  DOE-AAO did not demonstrate that training
          and qualification of their personnel was a top priority receiving constant management
          attention nor did they demonstrate a full understanding of the immense benefit that could
          be derived from a high-caliber training and qualification program.  The following issues
          illustrate the status of the DOE-AAO program:

       (a)               The training and qualification program appeared relatively ineffective based on
the 
                         results of level of knowledge interviews conducted on six DOE-AAO technical
                         personnel.  For example, several DOE-AAO personnel could not adequately
explain
                   ons, facility, and program managers.
          Although briefings on this restructuring have been given to individuals in the division, the
          details of the restructuring have not been formally promulgated.  Meanwhile, the
          certification process for weapons evolutions and actual weapons operations continue. 
          The lack of formal promulgation of this restructuring is not in keeping with the
          requirements placed on managers, supervisors, and operators by DOE Order 5480.19.
       
     3.   The M&H Drill Program was reviewed.  Only three drill sets have been run thus far in
          1995; all three were very simplistic.  The Drill Schedule for the remainder of 1995
          averages only four drill sets per quarter over all of the Manufacturing Division.
   
 5.  Follow-up Activities:  The Board's staff will continue to follow conduct of operations and
     training and qualification program implementation as part of normal staff reviews of Pantex
     activities.
