Attribute Accuracy: 

Attribute Accuracy Report: The attributes were Q.C.'ed against the original mylar manuscript for accuracy.

Logical Consistency Report: 
The polygons were Q.C.'ed against the original mylar maps for consistency. There are no node or label errors. This theme was built with polygon topology.

Completeness Report: This theme covers Western Oregon not including the Willamette Valley.

Process Step: 

Process Description: 
The mylar maps were digitized in ADS and carried into MOSS. These maps then were merged to create district-wide maps.

Process Date: 1991

Process Step: 

Process Description: 
The district-wide maps were converted to 100K Quads and then BLM contractors converted the data into Arc. The theme was projected from UTM 10 to Lambert 120.5 and polygon topology was built. The coverages were then
inserted into the Q100 Library.

Process Date: 1994

Process Step: 

Process Description: The Q100 library was converted from Arc/Info 6.1.2 to Arc/Info 7.0.2.
