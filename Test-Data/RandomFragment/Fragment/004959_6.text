o Women are far more likely than men to be victims of stalking--nearly 80
percent of stalking victims are women. Men are far more likely to be stalkers,
comprising 87 percent of the stalkers identified by victims participating in the
survey.

o Women are twice as likely as men to be victims of stalking by strangers and
eight times as likely to be victims of stalking by intimates.

In the United States today, more than 80 million adults and 10 million children
have access to the Internet. Assuming the proportion of cyberstalking victims is
even a fraction of the proportion of persons who have been the victims of
offline stalking, there may be potentially tens or even hundreds of thousands of
victims of cyberstalking incidents each year in the United States.


----------------------------

Actual Cyberstalking Incidents

o In the first successful prosecution under California's new cyberstalking law,
prosecutors in the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office obtained a guilty plea
from a 50-year-old former security guard who used the Internet to solicit the
rape of a woman who rejected his romantic advances. The defendant terrorized
his 28-year-old victim by impersonating her in various Internet chat rooms and
online bulletin boards, where he posted, along with her telephone number and
address, messages that she fantasized of being raped. On at least six occasions,
sometimes in the middle of the night, men knocked on the woman's door saying
they wanted to rape her. The former security guard pleaded guilty in April 1999
to one count of stalking and three counts of solicitation of sexual assault. He
faces up to 6 years in prison.

o A local prosecutor's office in Massachusetts charged a man who, using
anonymous remailers, allegedly engaged in a systematic pattern of harassment
of a coworker, which culminated in an attempt to extort sexual favors from the
victim under threat of disclosing past sexual activities to the victim's new
husband. 

o An honors graduate from the University of San Diego terrorized five female
university students over the Internet for more than a year. The victims received
hundreds of violent and threatening e-mails, sometimes receiving four or five
messages a day. The graduate student, who has entered a guilty plea and faces
up to 6 years in prison, told police he committed the crimes because he thought
the women were laughing at him and causing others to ridicule him. In fact, the
victims had never met him.

----------------------------

Anecdotal evidence from Federal law enforcement agencies further indicates
that cyberstalking is a serious and growing problem. At the Federal level,
several dozen matters have been referred, usually by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), to U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) for possible action. A
number of these cases have been referred to State and local law enforcement
agencies because the conduct does not appear to violate Federal law.

Local law enforcement agencies are beginning to see cases of cyberstalking as
well. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office estimated recently that e-mail
or other electronic communication is a factor in approximately 20 percent of the
roughly 600 cases referred to its Stalking and Threat Assessment Unit. The
chief of the Sex Crimes Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office also
estimates that about 20 percent of the unit's cases involve cyberstalking. The
Computer Investigations and Technology Unit of the New York City Police
Department estimates that almost 40 percent of its caseload involves electronic
threats and harassment--and virtually all of these have occurred in the past 3 or
4 years. 

ISPs are also receiving a growing number of complaints about harassing and
threatening behavior online. One major ISP reported receiving approximately
15 complaints per month of cyberstalking, in comparison to virtually no
complaints of cyberstalking just 1 or 2 years ago.

Finally, as part of a large study on sexual victimization of college women,
researchers at the University of Cincinnati conducted a national telephone
survey during the 1996-97 academic year of 4,446 randomly selected women
attending 2- and 4-year institutions of higher education. For the survey, the
researchers defined a stalking incident as one in which a respondent answered
positively when asked if someone had "repeatedly followed you, watched you,
phoned, written, e-mailed, or communicated with you in other ways that
seemed obsessive and made you afraid or concerned for your safety." The
study found that 581 women (13.1 percent) had been stalked and reported a
total of 696 stalking incidents (the latter figure exceeds the number of victims
because 15 percent of the women experienced more than one case of stalking
during the survey period). Of the 696 stalking incidents, 166 (23.9 percent)
involved e-mail. Thus, 25 percent of stalking incidents among college women
could be classified as involving cyberstalking.[5]

Current Efforts to Address Cyberstalking

The Law Enforcement Response

Cyberstalking is a relatively new challenge for most law enforcement agencies.
The first traditional stalking law was enacted by California in 1990. Since then,
some law enforcement agencies have trained their personnel on stalking and
have established specialized units to handle stalking cases. Nonetheless, many
agencies are still developing the expertise and resources to investigate and
prosecute traditional stalking cases. Only a handful of agencies throughout the
country have focused attention or resources specifically on the cyberstalking
problem.[6]

Law Enforcement Response: Awareness and Training Are Key Factors

Based on recent informal surveys of law enforcement agencies, it appears that
the majority of law enforcement agencies have not investigated or prosecuted
cyberstalking cases. However, some agencies--particularly those with units
dedicated to stalking or computer crime offenses--report having large
cyberstalking caseloads.

The disparity in the activity level among law enforcement agencies can be
attributed to a number of factors. First, it appears that most cyberstalking
victims do not report the conduct to law enforcement because they feel either
the behavior has not reached the point of being a crime or that law enforcement
will not take them seriously. Second, most law enforcement agents have not
been trained to recognize the serious nature of cyberstalking and to investigate
such offenses. Unfortunately, some victims have reported that rather than open
an investigation, law enforcement agencies have advised them to come back if
the cyberstalkers confront or threaten them offline. In several instances, victims
have been told by law enforcement simply to turn their computers off.

----------------------------

Cyberspace has become a fertile field for illegal activity. With the use of new
technology and equipment which cannot be policed by traditional methods,
cyberstalking has replaced traditional methods of stalking and harassment. In
addition, cyberstalking has led to offline incidents of violent crime. Police and
prosecutors need to be aware of the escalating numbers of these events and
devise strategies to resolve these problems through the criminal justice system.

--Linda Fairstein, Chief 
Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit 
Manhattan District Attorney's Office

----------------------------

Another indication that many law enforcement agencies may be unaware of the
magnitude of the cyberstalking problem is the wide disparity in the number of
cases reported in different jurisdictions across the country. For example, one
state attorney general's office in a Midwestern State indicated that it had been
receiving approximately one inquiry a week regarding cyberstalking cases and
knew of at least a dozen cases prosecuted throughout the State during the
preceding year. In contrast, the attorney general's offices in neighboring States
reported they had never received an inquiry about cyberstalking. Although
some disparity among jurisdictions would be expected, the size of the disparity
suggests that not all law enforcement agencies are receiving the training or
expertise needed to identify and respond to the problem.


----------------------------

Lack of Training Hinders Law Enforcement Response

A woman filed a complaint with her local police agency after receiving
numerous telephone calls in response to a notice posted on the Web by a man
claiming her 9-year-old daughter was available for sex, and providing her home
phone number with instructions to call 24 hours a day. The agency's response
was that she should change her telephone number. Instead she contacted the
FBI, which opened an investigation. It was discovered that the local police
agency did not have a computer expert and the investigative officer had never
used the Internet. The local agency's lack of familiarity and resources may have
resulted in a failure to understand the seriousness of the problem and the
response options available to law enforcement.

----------------------------

Law Enforcement Response: Jurisdictional and Statutory Limitations May
Frustrate Some Agencies

Cyberstalking also raises jurisdictional issues for law enforcement that can
frustrate agencies' attempts to address it. In many cases, the cyberstalker may
be in one city or State and the victim may be in another, making it more difficult
(and sometimes all but impossible) for the local authority to investigate the
incident. Even when a law enforcement agency is willing to pursue a case
across State lines, cooperation from agencies in neighboring States may not be
forthcoming when the conduct is limited to harassing e-mail messages and no
actual violence has occurred. A number of cases of suspected cyberstalking
have been referred to the FBI and USAOs because questions of jurisdiction
kept local law enforcement from pursuing the investigation.

The lack of adequate statutory authority further limits law enforcement's
response to cyberstalking incidents. At least 16 States have stalking statutes
that explicitly cover electronic communications,[7] and cyberstalking may be
covered under general stalking statutes in other States. In the remaining States,
however, cyberstalking may not meet the statutory definition of stalking and
therefore may not be considered a crime. In many cases, cyberstalking involves
threats to kill, kidnap, or injure a person or damage his or her reputation or
property and may be prosecuted under Federal or State laws that do not relate
directly to stalking.

Federal law may also limit law enforcement's ability to track down stalkers and
other criminals in cyberspace. In particular, the Cable Communications Policy
Act of 1984 (CCPA) prohibits the disclosure of cable subscriber records to
law enforcement agencies without a court order and advance notice to the
subscriber (47 U.S.C. ss 551(c), (h)). As more and more individuals turn to
cable companies as their ISPs, CCPA is posing a significant obstacle to the
investigation of cybercrimes, including cyberstalking. For example, under
CCPA, a law enforcement agency investigating a cyberstalker who uses a cable
company for Internet access would have to notify the cyberstalker that the
agency has requested his or her subscriber records, thereby jeopardizing the
criminal investigation. While it is appropriate to prohibit the indiscriminate
disclosure of cable records to law enforcement agencies, the better approach
would be to harmonize Federal law by providing law enforcement access to
cable subscriber records under the same privacy safeguards that currently
govern law enforcement access to records of electronic mail subscribers under
18 U.S.C. ss 2703. Moreover, special provisions could be drafted to protect
against the inappropriate disclosure of records that would reveal a customer's
viewing habits.

Law Enforcement Response: The Challenge of Anonymity

Another complication for law enforcement investigation of cyberstalking cases
is the presence of services that enable anonymous communications over the
Internet. Although anonymity provides important benefits for Internet users,
including protection of privacy, as discussed earlier, it also provides
cyberstalkers with advantages over both their victims and law enforcement.

Anonymity on the Internet can be obtained in one of two ways. The first is by
buying Internet services that allow individuals to create free electronic
mailboxes through a Web site. While most ISPs request identifying information
from users of this service, they almost never authenticate or otherwise confirm
the information. In addition, payment for these services is typically made in
advance through a money order or other nontraceable form. As long as
payment is received in advance, the service is provided to the account holder
who may remain unknown. The second way is by using e-mail servers that
purposefully strip identifying information and transport headers from the e-mail.
By forwarding e-mail through several of these services serially, a stalker can
make the message completely anonymous. The availability of both types of
service makes it relatively easy for cyberstalkers to send anonymous
communications but very difficult for victims, service providers, and law
enforcement to identify the communications source.

Law Enforcement Response: Specialized Units Show Promise in Combating
Cyberstalking


A critical step in combating cyberstalking is understanding stalking in general.
Because offline and online stalking share some characteristics, many strategies
and techniques that have been developed to combat stalking in general often
can be adapted to cyberstalking situations.

At the Federal level, the Justice Department has established a number of task
forces and special crime units that focus solely on high-technology crimes.
These units do not address cyberstalking alone, but they have the necessary
expertise in computers and the Internet to assist in the investigation of
cyberstalking when it arises. For example, the FBI has computer crime squads
throughout the country, as well as the National Infrastructure Protection Center
in Washington, D.C., to ensure cybercrimes are properly investigated.
Additionally, they have computer analysis and response teams to conduct
forensic examinations on seized magnetic media. Similarly, in 1996, the Justice
Department established the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
within the Criminal Division, which is a unit with highly trained personnel who
remain on the cutting edge of new technology and investigative techniques. In
addition, each U.S. Attorney's Office contains experienced computer crime
prosecutors who help investigate and prosecute a variety of computer crimes,
including cyberstalking. They work closely with State-level special divisions that
have been established in several State attorney generals' offices to focus on
computer crimes.

Some larger metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and New York City,
have seen numerous incidents of cyberstalking and have created special crime
units to investigate and prosecute these cases. The Los Angeles Stalking and
Threat Assessment Team combines special sections of the police department
and district attorney's office to ensure properly trained investigators and
prosecutors are available when cyberstalking cases arise. In addition, the unit is
given adequate resources, including computer hardware and advanced training,
which are essential for investigating and prosecuting these technical cases.
Similarly, the New York City Police Department's Computer Investigation and
Technology Unit provides regular training for police officers and prosecutors
regarding the intricacies of cyberstalking investigations and prosecutions. The
training focuses on understanding how chat rooms operate, how to obtain and
preserve electronic evidence, and how to draft search warrants and subpoenas.

The programs in New York City and Los Angeles both ensure that
enforcement personnel have the resources and training needed to fight
cyberstalking. Traditional law enforcement techniques for surveillance,
investigation, and evidence gathering require modification for use on computer
networks and often require the use of unfamiliar legal processes. Law
enforcement at all levels must be properly trained to use network investigative
techniques and legal processes while protecting the privacy of legitimate users
of the Internet. Just as a burglar might leave fingerprints at the scene of a crime,
a cyberstalker can leave an "electronic trail" on the Web that properly trained
law enforcement personnel can follow back to the source.

Cyberstalking is expected to increase as computers and the Internet become
more popular. Accordingly, law enforcement at all levels must become more
sensitive to cyberstalking complaints and devote the necessary training and
resources to allow proper investigation and prosecution. By becoming
technologically proficient and understanding stalking in general, agencies will be
better prepared to respond to cyberstalking incidents in their jurisdictions. In
addition, State and local agencies can turn to their local FBI office or USAO
for technical assistance. Also, computer crime units and domestic violence units
should share information and expertise, because many cyberstalking cases
include elements of both computer crime and domestic violence. Finally, law
enforcement must become more sensitive to the fear and frustration
experienced by cyberstalking victims. Proper training should help in this regard,
but law enforcement at all levels should take the next step and place special
emphasis on this problem. Computers and the Internet are becoming
indispensable parts of America's culture, and cyberstalking is a growing threat.
Responding to a victim's complaint by saying "turn off your computer" or
"change your telephone number" is not acceptable.

Industry Efforts

Although the Internet industry has tried to combat abusive electronic
communications overall, it has not addressed cyberstalking in particular. Most
major ISPs have established an address to which complaints of abusive or
harassing electronic mail can be sent (generally, this address is abuse@[the
ISP's domain]). In addition, these providers almost uniformly have provisions in
their online agreements prohibiting abusive or harassing conduct through their
service and stipulate that violations of the policy will result in termination of the
account.

In practice, however, ISPs have focused more on assisting their customers in
avoiding annoying online behavior, such as receiving unsolicited commercial
e-mail (spamming) or large amounts of e-mail intentionally sent to an individual
(mail bombing). Less attention has been paid to helping victims of cyberstalking
or other electronic threats. For some ISPs, the procedures for lodging
complaints of online harassment or threats are difficult to locate, and their
policies about what constitutes a violation of service agreements are generally
not helpful. In addition, many ISPs do not inform their customers about what
steps, if any, the ISP has taken to followup on customer complaints. These
problems--hard-to-locate complaint procedures, vague policies about what
does and does not constitute prohibited harassment, and inadequate followup
on complaints--may pose serious obstacles to cyberstalking victims who need
help.

Online industry associations respond that providing such protection to their
customers is costly and difficult. Although they recognize that larger ISPs have
begun to commit resources to dealing with harassment online, they caution that
the costs of imposing additional reporting or response obligations on ISPs may
make it difficult for small or entrepreneurial ISPs to continue providing service
at competitive rates. For example, the Commercial Internet Exchange, whose
members carry approximately 75 percent of United States backbone traffic,
cautions that no attempt to impose reporting requirements should be made
unless fully justified by the record. However, according to the same group, the
decentralized nature of the Internet would make it difficult for providers to
collect and submit such data. Accordingly, evidence of the scope of the
cyberstalking problem is likely to be defined primarily by growing anecdotal
evidence with limited factual basis to determine whether the phenomenon is
growing, static, or declining.

Industry Efforts: Educating and Protecting Consumers

Despite the difficulty in fully defining the scope of the cyberstalking problem, the
industry has made notable efforts to inform consumers about ways to protect
themselves online. Such information is principally focused on protecting children
and consumers on the Internet. For example, since 1996, the Internet Alliance,
one of the key Internet industry groups, has worked with the Federal Trade
Commission and government agencies on Project OPEN (Online Public
Education Network). Project OPEN provides information about fraud, parental
controls, and privacy protection. Although this information is not specifically
relevant to cyberstalking, much of the advice about protecting children and
safeguarding privacy while online may be of assistance to individuals who want
to use the Internet while being protected against potential cyberstalkers. More
recently, a number of industry organizations have joined together to develop
GetNetWise.Com--a single, comprehensive online resource to help parents and
children use the Internet in a safe and educational manner.

Other similar industry efforts have been announced to address aspects of
computer-related crime. For example, the Justice Department and the
Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) announced the
Cybercitizen Partnership in March 1999. This partnership is intended to boost
cooperation between industry and government, expand public awareness of
computer crime issues among children and adolescents, and provide resources
for government to draw on in addressing computer crime. The industry has also
responded to the complaints of parents who are worried about the content
available to their children over the Internet. The One Click Away initiative gives
parents important information about protecting their children in one central
location. Similar education and outreach efforts, approached through
cooperation between industry and government, may educate individuals
concerned about these issues and mitigate some of the dangers of
cyberstalking.

Other Internet industry sectors have begun to address aspects of the
cyberstalking problem. Many of their solutions focus on the ability of individuals
to protect themselves against unwanted communications. For example, most
Internet chat facilities offer users the ability to block, squelch, or ignore chat
messages or "paging" from individuals who are attempting to annoy or threaten
them. Similarly, many e-mail users have tools that allow them to block e-mail
from individuals who are attempting to harass or annoy them. Such a solution
may be useful in situations where the communications are merely annoying.
Unfortunately, such a solution is less appropriate when threatening
communications are received, because victims who never "receive" the threat
may not know they are being stalked and may be alerted, for the first time,
when the stalker shows up to act on the threat.

In another type of response, providers have set up gated communities for
individuals, families, and children. The techniques used by these communities
are still in the developmental stages and range from specialized servers, which
allow potentially objectionable content to be filtered at the server, to designated
areas for children and teens, which place restrictions on the amount or types of
personal information that will be provided to others. Individuals who are
concerned about being stalked may find refuge in these communities.

While these efforts all reflect important initiatives for self-protection, both
industry and government representatives agree that a key component of
addressing the cyberstalking problem is education and empowerment. If
individuals are given direction about how to protect themselves against
threatening or harassing communications, and how to report incidents when
they do occur, both the industry and law enforcement will be in positions to
cooperate in conducting investigations.

Industry Efforts: Cooperation With Law Enforcement

Both industry and law enforcement benefit when crime over the Internet is
reduced. In particular, the Internet industry benefits significantly whenever
citizen and consumer confidence and trust in the Internet are increased.
Accordingly, both industry and law enforcement recognize the need to
cooperate more fully with one another in this area. Industry representatives
have noted that contact between industry and law enforcement--particularly in
the area of harassment--is sporadic and episodic. Industry representatives, who
were consulted as part of the preparation of this chapter, indicated their
willingness to participate in training efforts for law enforcement. Law
enforcement personnel--particularly on the State and local levels, who are often
the first responders to cyberstalking complaints--should engage industry
representatives in dialogue and take advantage of the expertise offered by the
industry in designing training programs. Closer cooperation between law
enforcement and industry will ensure that law enforcement officers know whom
to call at the ISPs and how to proceed when they receive a complaint, and
ISPs will have a contact in law enforcement when they receive a complaint that
warrants intervention.

Adequacy of Existing Laws

State Cyberstalking Laws

Fewer than one-third of the States have antistalking laws that explicitly cover
cyberstalking. California, for example, only recently amended its stalking statute
to cover it. The amended law was used to prosecute a 50-year-old former
security guard who pleaded guilty to one count of stalking and three counts of
solicitation of sexual assault after using the Internet to solicit the rape of a
woman who rejected his romantic advances. Although general stalking statutes
in some States may cover cyberstalking, all States should review their laws to
ensure they prohibit, and provide appropriate punishment for, stalking through
the Internet and other electronic communications.

Federal Cyberstalking Laws

Federal law provides a number of important tools to combat cyberstalking.
Under 18 U.S.C. ss 875(c), it is a Federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years
in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, to transmit any communication in
interstate or foreign commerce containing a threat to injure another person.
Section 875(c) applies to any communication transmitted in interstate or foreign
commerce--including threats transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce
through telephone, e-mail, beepers, and the Internet.

Although 18 U.S.C. ss 875(c) is an important antistalking measure, it has
limited application. First, it applies only to communications of actual threats and
cannot be used in a case where a stalker engaged in a pattern of conduct
intended to harass or annoy another (absent some threat). Also, it is not clear
that it would apply to situations where a person harasses or terrorizes another
by posting messages on a bulletin board or in a chat room encouraging others
to harass or annoy another person, as in the California case.

Certain forms of cyberstalking also may be prosecuted under 47 U.S.C. ss
223. One provision of this statute makes it a Federal crime, punishable by up to
2 years in prison, to use a telephone or telecommunications device to annoy,
abuse, harass, or threaten any person at the number called.[8] The statute also
requires that the perpetrator has not revealed his or her name (see 47 U.S.C. ss
223(a)(1)(C)). Although this statute is broader than 18 U.S.C. ss 875, covering
both threats and harassment, Section 223 applies only to direct communications
between the perpetrator and the victim. It would not reach a cyberstalking
situation if a person harasses or terrorizes another person by posting messages
on a bulletin board or in a chat room encouraging others to harass or terrorize
that person. Moreover, Section 223 is only a misdemeanor, punishable by not
more than 2 years in prison.

The Interstate Stalking Act, signed into law in 1996, made it a crime for any
person to travel across State lines with the intent to injure or harass another
person and, in the course thereof, to place that person or a member of that
person's family in a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury (see 18
U.S.C. ss 2261A). 

Finally, a law was passed in October 1998 that protects children against online
stalking. The statute, 18 U.S.C. ss 2425, makes it a Federal crime to use any
means of interstate or foreign commerce (such as a telephone line or the
Internet) to communicate with any person with the intent to solicit or entice a
child into unlawful sexual activity. While this new statute provides important
protections for children, it does not reach harassing phone calls to minors
absent a showing of intent to entice or solicit the child for illicit sexual purposes.

----------------------------

First Amendment and Other Legal Considerations

All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government have
passed laws that criminalize stalking to address the serious harms and dangers
that result from stalking, including the fear of violence and loss of privacy and
control suffered by the victim. In addition to these direct harms, stalking is
frequently a precursor to physical violence against the victim. By its nature,
however, stalking is not a crime that can be defined with a particular discrete
set of acts. Frequently, stalking consists of a course of conduct that may involve
a broad range of harassing, intimidating, and threatening behavior directed at a
victim. The conduct can be as varied as the stalker's imagination and ability to
take actions that harass, threaten, and force himself or herself into the life and
consciousness of the victim. As new technologies become available, as is the
case with the Internet and cyberstalking, stalkers adapt those technologies to
new ways of stalking victims.

As a result of the breadth of conduct potentially involved in stalking, antistalking
statutes need to be relatively broad to be effective. At the same time, because
of that breadth and because stalking can involve expressive conduct and
speech, antistalking statutes must be carefully formulated and enforced so as
not to impinge on speech that is protected by the First Amendment. This is true
with regard to cyberstalking laws, which frequently involve speech over the
Internet. The Internet has been recognized as an important tool for protected
speech activities. See, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S.
844, 850-52, 870 (1997).

The fact that stalking behavior (including cyberstalking) may implicate important
issues of free speech does not eliminate the significant public interest in its
criminal regulation or suggest that all criminal regulation would be prohibited by
the freedom of speech guarantees of the First Amendment. The First
Amendment does not prohibit any and all regulations that may involve or have
an impact on speech. Of particular relevance to stalking, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recognized that governments may criminalize true threats without
violating the First Amendment. See, e.g., Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705
(1969) (per curiam). Stalking (and cyberstalking) generally involves conduct
reasonably understood to constitute a threat of violence, and such threats may
be criminalized consistent with the First Amendment. 

One of the recommendations in this chapter calls on States to review and
update their statutes to cover electronic communications in their stalking laws.
Care must be taken in drafting cyberstalking statutes to ensure that they are not
so broad that they risk chilling constitutionally protected speech, such as
political protest and other legitimate conduct. A carefully drafted statute can
provide broad protections against cyberstalking without running afoul of the
First Amendment. 

----------------------------

Federal legislation was enacted recently to fill the gaps in current law. Although
most cyberstalking cases will fall within the jurisdiction of State and local
authorities, there are instances--such as serious cyber harassment directed at a
victim in another State or involving communications intended to aid and abet
third parties in harassment or threats--where State law is inadequate, questions
of jurisdiction arise, or State and local agencies do not have the expertise or
resources to investigate and prosecute a case. (See page 41 for a description of
the Federal cyberstalking offense enacted as part of the Violence Against
Women Act of 2000.)

Recommendations

General Recommendations

o The law enforcement community, private industry, victim assistance
providers, and individuals must recognize that cyberstalking is a serious
problem--not only as a potential precursor to offline threats and violence, but
also as a serious invasion of an increasingly important aspect of people's
everyday lives. At the same time, it is important to note that many forms of
annoying and menacing activity on the Internet do not rise to the level of illegal
activity and are properly addressed by individuals and service providers without
recourse to law enforcement channels.

o The lack of comprehensive data on the nature and extent of cyberstalking
makes it difficult to develop effective response strategies. Future surveys and
research studies on stalking should, where possible, include specific information
on cyberstalking. Industry organizations can and should play a role not only in
increasing the amount of data on the cyberstalking problem but also in ensuring
that the data can be analyzed in a meaningful way.

Legislation Recommendations

o State legislators should review their existing stalking and other statutes to
determine whether they address cyberstalking and, if not, promptly expand
such laws to address cyberstalking.

o Federal law also should be amended to make it easier to track down stalkers
and other criminals in cyberspace while maintaining safeguards for privacy. In
particular, the Cable Communications Policy Act should be amended to
provide access to the same type of subscriber records, under the same
standards and privacy safeguards, as those for electronic mail subscribers under
18 U.S.C. ss 2703 (while maintaining strict limits on access to records that
reveal customer viewing habits).

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Recommendations

o Law enforcement agencies and courts need to recognize the serious nature of
cyberstalking, including the close links between offline and online stalking.

o Law enforcement agencies need training on the nature and extent of the
cyberstalking problem, including specific training on the legal tools available to
address the problem, the need for and effectiveness of prompt action by law
enforcement agencies, the most effective techniques to investigate and
prosecute cyberstalking crimes, and the resources available to cyberstalking
victims.

o Law enforcement agencies with existing stalking or computer crime units
should consider expanding the mission of such units to include cyberstalking,
and law enforcement agencies that do not have a stalking section should
consider expanding their capabilities to address both offline and online stalking.
At the least, law enforcement agencies should understand the patterns
underlying stalking in general and be prepared to respond and intercede on
behalf of cyberstalking victims.

o Law enforcement agencies should use mechanisms for quickly and reliably
sharing information about cyberstalking incidents with other law enforcement
agencies, thereby making it less likely that a cyberstalker can continue
threatening behavior simply because neither the jurisdiction of the sender nor
the jurisdiction of the victim can prosecute the offender.

o U.S. Attorneys' Offices, in consultation with other Federal, State, and local
agencies, should examine the available resources and networks of investigators
and prosecutors with the expertise to handle cyberstalking investigations. These
include violent crime specialists, computer crime investigators and prosecutors,
computer forensic specialists, and victim-witness coordinators. The Law
Enforcement Coordinating Committees, which have been established in each
USAO and are designed to foster coordination among law enforcement
agencies, would be an appropriate body for addressing these issues.

o Law enforcement agencies should work more closely with victim advocacy
groups to identify cyberstalking patterns and victim experiences and to
encourage cyberstalking victims to report incidents to law enforcement
authorities.

Industry Recommendations

o The Internet and electronic communication industry should create an
industry-supported Web site containing information about cyberstalking and
what to do if confronted with this problem. Contact information for the major
ISPs should be included so that Internet users can easily report cyberstalking
cases after visiting this centralized resource. This recommendation could be
implemented by expanding the One Click Away initiative or through a
complementary but separate initiative focused on cyberstalking.

o The industry should develop additional means to empower individuals to
protect themselves against cyberstalking. Such means might include more
accessible and effective filtering and blocking options. While some major ISPs
already allow such options, others do not.

o The industry should develop training materials to help law enforcement
investigate and prosecute cyberstalking and related crimes. For example, a
short training video could be developed to increase awareness of the
cyberstalking problem and to provide law enforcement officers with essential
information on how to work with ISPs and others in the investigation of
cyberstalking cases.

o The industry should cooperate fully with law enforcement when they are
investigating cyberstalking complaints. It can do this, for example, by
immediately freezing and retaining data for law enforcement use on any potential
cyberstalking case.

o The industry should establish best business practices to address illicit activity
by terminating holders of fraudulent accounts.

o The industry should sponsor an Internet Security and Law Enforcement
Council of ISPs and other members of the Internet community to develop and
promote industry best business practices relating to security and law
enforcement issues (including cyberstalking), develop and distribute training
materials for law enforcement about the investigation and prosecution of
Internet crime, and promote more effective communication and cooperation
between industry and law enforcement in combating online criminal activity.

o The industry should establish and enforce clear policies that prohibit
cyberstalking and related behaviors, including terminating the accounts of
persons who violate such policies. While it appears that most of the larger ISPs
have such policies, some smaller ISPs do not. Representatives from the Internet
industry should consider establishing an industrywide code of conduct that
encourages all ISPs to adopt such procedures.

o The industry should establish clear, accessible, and understandable
procedures for individuals--customers and noncustomers--to register
complaints about use of a company's service to engage in cyberstalking.



o The industry should develop and widely disseminate educational materials to
customers and others on how to protect themselves online.

Advocate and Victim Services Provider Recommendations

o Victim services providers and advocates should provide direct services and
referrals to resources designed to assist victims of cyberstalking and work to
ensure that cyberstalking services are expanded to meet the needs of victims
and enhance their safety.

o Victim services providers and advocates should train domestic violence and
other advocates on Internet technology, the tactics used by cyberstalkers, and
how to respond to the specific needs of cyberstalking victims.

o Victim services providers and advocates should name the behavior as
cyberstalking and validate that a crime is occurring when working with
individual victims.

o Victim services providers and advocates should serve as catalysts in
community efforts to form partnerships among law enforcement, prosecution,
the judiciary, the medical community, and other community allies to address the
specific safety needs of cyberstalking victims and to hold offenders accountable
for their actions.

o Victim services providers and advocates should raise public awareness about
the devastating impact on cyberstalking victims of the tactics used by
cyberstalkers and the steps that can be taken to prevent and combat this crime.

o Victim services providers and advocates should inform public policy
decisionmaking.

Protecting Yourself Against Cyberstalking and What To Do If You Are a
Victim

Prevention Tips

o Do not share personal information in public spaces anywhere online, nor give
it to strangers, including in e-mail or chat rooms. Do not use your real name or
nickname as your screen name or user ID. Pick a name that is gender and age
neutral, and do not post personal information as part of any user profiles.

o Be extremely cautious about meeting online acquaintances in person. If you
choose to meet, do so in a public place and take along a friend.

o Make sure that your ISP and Internet Relay Chat network have an
acceptable-use policy that prohibits cyberstalking. If your network fails to
respond to your complaints, consider switching to a provider that is more
responsive to user complaints.

o If a situation online becomes hostile, log off or surf elsewhere. If a situation
places you in fear, contact a local law enforcement agency.

What To Do If You Are Being Cyberstalked

o If you are receiving unwanted contact, make clear to that person that you
would like him or her not to contact you again.

o Save all communications for evidence. Do not edit or alter them in any way.
Also, keep a record of your contacts with Internet system administrators and
law enforcement officials.

o You may want to consider blocking or filtering messages from the harasser.
Many e-mail programs such as Eudora and Microsoft Outlook have a filter
feature, and software can be easily obtained that will automatically delete
e-mails from a particular e-mail address or that contain offensive words. Chat
room contact can be blocked as well. Although formats differ, a common chat
room command to block someone would be to type /ignore<person's screen
name> (without the brackets). However, in some circumstances (such as
threats of violence), it may be more appropriate to save the information and
contact law enforcement authorities.

o If harassment continues after you have asked the person to stop, contact the
harasser's ISP. Most ISPs have clear policies prohibiting the use of their
services to abuse another person. Often, an ISP can try to stop the conduct by
direct contact with the stalker or by closing his or her account. If you receive
abusive e-mails, identify the domain (after the "@" sign) and contact that ISP.
Most ISPs have an e-mail address such as abuse@<domain name> or
postmaster@<domain name> that can be used for complaints. If the ISP has a
Web site, visit it for information on how to file a complaint. 

o Contact your local police department and inform its officers of the situation in
as much detail as possible. In appropriate cases, they may refer the matter to
State or Federal authorities. If you are afraid to take action, there are resources
available to help you. Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline,
1-800-799-SAFE (phone) or 1-800-787-3224 (TDD), or a local women's
shelter for advice and support.

Chapter 2 
Law Enforcement and Prosecution Response to Stalking--Results of a National
Survey

This chapter examines the criminal justice system's response to stalking across
the country by providing an overview of State laws and case law on stalking
and reporting the results of a national survey of law enforcement and
prosecution practices in this area.[9]

Survey of State Laws

Every State, and the District of Columbia, has enacted some type of stalking
law. In 12 States, conviction for a first offense of stalking is automatically a
felony, and in 23 States, a first offense of stalking may be a felony. In the
remaining 15 States, a first offense is a misdemeanor, but a repeat stalking
conviction is a felony.

Many States have statutes that address stalking-related conduct. Offenses
include harassment (25 States), threats and intimidation (35 States and the
District of Columbia), telephone threats or harassment (43 States), and letter
threats (20 States). Ten States provide enhanced felony penalties for
harassment or stalking of a minor.

Twenty-seven States provide for civil protection orders to be issued against
stalking, in addition to orders of protection against domestic violence. Violation
of a stalking protection order is a crime in 25 of these States and may be
criminal contempt of court in the other 2 States. In only five States can a
violation of the stalking order be treated as a felony; in many others, repeat
stalking in violation of an order is aggravated stalking and a felony. In addition,
in eight States, repeat violations of a stalking order can be a felony. In six
States, legislation provides for the entry of stalking protection orders into a
special statewide registry for these orders. Thirty-five States also have registries
for domestic violence protection orders, and these orders often include
antistalking provisions.

In 10 States where stalking can be a misdemeanor offense, State law authorizes
warrantless arrest for stalking, similar to that authorized for misdemeanor
domestic violence. In the 12 States where stalking is always a felony,
warrantless arrest is authorized where probable cause exists. In Mississippi,
warrantless arrest for misdemeanor stalking is authorized where the stalking is
against a spouse or former spouse.

Training of law enforcement officers on stalking is required only in Minnesota
and Nevada. However, 30 States require law enforcement training on domestic
violence, a requirement that may be administratively interpreted to include
stalking.

Case Law Review

As of August 2000, nearly 500 stalking and related cases prosecuted at the
Federal, State, and local levels had been identified (see appendix A). Cases
involving stalking were most common (157 cases), followed by harassment
(142 cases) and threats (122 cases). Only a few State stalking laws have been
struck down on the basis of overly vague terms such as "annoy" or lacking an
intent requirement. 

Double-jeopardy claims were another common challenge, typically where there
had been a previous finding of contempt of court for violation of a court order,
such as a protection order or an injunction. Rulings varied based on whether the
criminal offense and the contempt offense shared common facts. Where the
court found that the two offenses shared common facts, it ruled that a criminal
trial for both offenses violated the defendant's constitutional right not to be tried
twice for the same crime.

Harassment laws that are not limited to prohibitions on "fighting words," which
are not entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment as are other
kinds of speech, were the most vulnerable to constitutional challenge.[10]
However, courts held that telephone harassment laws were not required to
have such a limitation because of their invasion of privacy component. For
much the same reason, telephone harassment and threat laws commonly focus
on the intent of the caller to harass or threaten rather than the victim's response
to these messages. In fact, a few States do not require actual fear to result from
the harassment.

Despite the growing popularity of electronic communication, there are very few
reported cases involving this medium. Some of the cases indicate that courts
may be reluctant to apply old laws to this new means of delivering threats or
harassing communications without explicit statutory language addressing the use
of electronic communication to stalk, harass, or threaten.

Practitioner Surveys

Two hundred and four law enforcement agencies and 222 prosecution offices in
jurisdictions with populations of more than 250,000 were surveyed by mail in
November 1997. The survey asked what special efforts these agencies had
undertaken against stalking, including special units, training, and written policies
and procedures.[11] The survey found that all but seven of the police agencies
surveyed assign stalking cases either to their detective unit or to a specialized
unit, most commonly the domestic violence unit, or to a combination of
detectives and domestic violence investigators. A few agencies assign stalking
cases to their sex crimes unit. Only one has a specialized stalking unit.

Most of the prosecution offices surveyed similarly assign stalking cases to their
domestic violence unit. A significant minority (15 percent) split stalking case
duties between their domestic violence unit and another unit, usually the general
trial unit. Another important pattern is for stalking to be handled by a special
unit that is responsible for prosecution of domestic violence, sex crimes, and
other kinds of specialized cases such as child or elder abuse. Seven offices
have either a specialized stalking unit or an assistant or deputy prosecutor who
specializes in stalking cases.

Stalking training for police recruits is typically part of their domestic violence
training. About 13 percent of the agencies have specialized training on stalking
independent of domestic violence, although several offer both types of training.
Less than 15 percent of the police agencies do not offer stalking training to
recruits. Significantly, more than one-third do not provide inservice stalking
training to their officers. Slightly more than half reported that inservice training
on stalking is provided to all detectives or to special unit detectives.

Most of the prosecution offices surveyed (82 percent) provide some training on
stalking. About 25 percent of the offices provide inservice stalking training to all
their attorneys, and 17 percent provide stalking training to new attorneys. Most
of the latter agencies provide both inservice and new attorney training. More
than one-third of the offices limit their inservice training to special unit
prosecutors. Ten percent of the prosecution offices said that the only stalking
training their attorneys get is from outside training sources.

Fifty-seven percent of the police agencies surveyed have written policies and
procedures for handling stalking cases, most often as part of their domestic
violence protocols. Only 11 agencies have separate stalking protocols. A
slightly smaller proportion (50 percent) of prosecution offices said they had
written policies for prosecuting stalking cases. Only six offices have separate
stalking protocols, including one office with both policies and protocols.

The written comments provided by the respondents indicate that prosecutors in
several States have problems with the statutory "credible threat" requirement.
However, some prosecutors in these States did not report such problems. The
reasons for this difference may be related to methods of coordination between
law enforcement and prosecution in stalking cases. The need for training was
expressed by many respondents.

Field Studies

Site visits have been completed in six locations: the Los Angeles Police
Department's threat management unit, the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's stalking and threat assessment prosecution unit, the San Diego
County District Attorney's stalking prosecution unit, the San Jose Police
Department's stalking unit, the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office,
and the Colorado Springs Police Department. 

Preliminary findings from these sites show some significant similarities:

o Specialized stalking units provide expertise in identifying, investigating, and
prosecuting stalking crimes.

o Staffing of specialized units is essentially experimental, so central units share
jurisdiction over stalking crimes with other agency units, taking only the most
serious cases.

o Failure to identify stalking behavior is a continuing problem. All of the
specialized units devote considerable resources to training other criminal justice
personnel and educating the community.

o Because both stalking legislation and specialized stalking units are relatively
new, case management requires the development of new techniques for
investigation and for ensuring victim safety. Investigators and prosecutors of
stalking operate as problem solvers for tasks such as identifying who the stalker
is, how to prove stalking, and how to work with victims to collect evidence
while keeping them safe.

Training Programs

A number of jurisdictions provide training on stalking. A few jurisdictions have
had training for only their law enforcement officers, typically of a limited
duration (e.g., rollcall training). Many others have had more extensive training,
typically involving multidisciplinary audiences. Some prosecutors have provided
informal training to the judiciary on stalking issues through extensive filings of
motions and briefs that explain the nature of stalking and its impact on victims.

----------------------------

Chapter 3 
Victim Needs

In Stalking in America: Findings From the National Violence Against Women
Survey,[12] the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) reported that stalking is much
more prevalent than previously thought, with an estimated 1 million women and
370,000 men stalked annually. The report found that stalking is most often
perpetrated against current or former intimate partners, with young women
between ages 18 and 29 as the primary targets. More recently, in the 2000
Report to Congress evaluating the STOP Violence Against Women Formula
Grants, the Urban Institute noted that stalking is the least understood of the
three crimes addressed by VAWA. Only eight States address stalking in their
STOP implementation plans.[13]

Based on these reports and the growing body of research on stalking and
domestic violence, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime
(OVC) convened a national focus group to gather information about the needs
of stalking victims. The focus group brought together stalking victims, victim
advocates, and victim assistance providers, as well as prosecutors and law
enforcement officers who have worked with stalking victims. Their discussion
explored the effects of stalking on victims' lives and how communities can better
address the needs of stalking victims. Participants who had been stalked
described the psychological and physical impact of the terrorizing tactics used
by their stalkers. Others shared information from their experiences in assisting
victims who had been stalked. Participants identified gaps in service provision
and barriers to accessing services and made recommendations for improving
aid to stalking victims and preventing future crimes. This chapter summarizes the
focus group discussion.

Victim Experiences of Stalking

The victims participating in the discussion described frightening accounts of
being stalked for as long as years at a time. One participant was stalked by a
man she had dated, two participants by former spouses, one by a former
employee, one by a stranger who was mentally ill, one by a neighbor, and one
by a cyberstalker of unknown identity. Their experiences varied based on
multiple factors: 

o Their relationship with the stalker.

o The mental health status of the stalker.

o The motivations of the stalker, if known. 

o The tactics used by the stalker.

o The frequency, intensity, and intrusiveness of the stalking acts.

o Whether the stalker also was targeting the victim's family and friends.

o The locations where the stalking acts occurred, such as workplace or college
campus. 

o The levels of support and services available in their communities.

o The accessibility of community support and services, which varied based on
factors such as disabilities, financial status, and gender.

o Whether the justice system was proactive on the victim's behalf.

o Whether the stalker's behavior stopped.

While the specific circumstances surrounding the stalking were unique, victims
recounted many similar issues and concerns. The most common result of the
stalking was the terror it evoked in victims.

Tactics Used to Control Victims

The motive for stalking is not sexual; rather, it is anger or hostility toward the
victim and a desire to control the victim. Participants in the focus group asserted
that their stalkers had systematically tried to subjugate them. Stalkers employ
various acts of terrorism over a period of weeks, months, years, or even
decades, which has the cumulative effect of eroding victims' self-confidence and
sense of control over their lives. Some acts convey subtle messages meant to
instill fear, while others brutally remind victims of their stalkers' dominance over
them. Discussion participants described a range of stalking tactics that included:

o Leaving or sending unwanted messages, such as sending letters written in
blood or cut-up pictures of victims. 

o Breaking into and vandalizing property, such as homes and cars.

o Following, harassing, and defaming victims.

----------------------------

One victim was stalked for 3 years, during which the stalker broke into her
house, beat her, and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. 

In addition to enduring beatings, vandalism to her house and car, and threats
of bodily injury, another victim received 6 to 10 unwanted letters a day from
her stalker, typically 8 pages long, written on both sides.

In another case, a stalker widely disseminated false information on the
Internet--claiming, among other things, that the victim was available for sex and
listing her address and phone number.

----------------------------

o Tracking down victims' contact information in cases in which victims try to
hide (e.g., through neighbors, employers, and even the police). 

o Impersonating people trusted by victims to obtain access to them.

o Threatening physical harm or death to victims, family members, and friends,
such as threatening to place a bomb in a victim's car or to kill a victim's lawyer.

o Killing victims' pets. 

o Kidnapping victims.

o Physically attacking and torturing victims. 

o Sexually assaulting victims.

o Using weapons to hurt or kill victims.

The control tactics described by focus group participants mirror those tactics
reported in the National Violence Against Women (NVAW) survey. The
survey found that the most common activities engaged in by stalkers include
following or spying on victims, standing outside victims' homes or places of
work or recreation (82 percent), making unsolicited phone calls (61 percent),
sending or leaving unwanted letters or other items (33 percent), vandalizing
property (29 percent), and killing or threatening to kill family pets (9
percent).[14]

Dealing With Fear 

In the face of the danger posed by their stalkers, victims typically confront the
daily task of keeping themselves and their family members safe. They may tell
family, friends, employers, coworkers, daycare providers, and criminal justice
system professionals about what is happening in attempts to seek assistance.
Like victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, stalking victims sometimes
spend an inordinate amount of time attempting to convince others to believe that
they are being stalked and are in real danger. Participants reported that victims
deal with varying reactions from others, including:

o Disbelief.

o Blaming the victim for causing the stalking, particularly in cases where victims
know their stalkers.

o Believing the victim but refusing to help or support the victim.

o Believing the victim, taking the victim's concerns seriously, and offering
support and assistance. 

----------------------------

A number of victims described stalking as a nightmare that invaded all aspects
of their lives. They spent a great deal of energy, time, and money just trying to
stay alive. 

----------------------------

The victims participating in the discussion all reported stalking or related abuses
to local police at some point. Some victims encountered disbelief or apathy
from officers. Others indicated that officers were sympathetic to their plight but
lacked the legal authority to intervene to stop the stalking. In some instances,
stalkers were eventually charged with crimes, convicted, and incarcerated. In
other cases, the stalkers' acts were not considered illegal and the victims fled
and relocated to other states.

According to the NVAW survey, 55 percent of the surveyed female victims
reported their stalking to the police.[15] When other victims were asked why
they chose not to report their stalking to the police, they stated that the stalking
was not a police matter, they thought the police would not be able to do
anything, or they feared reprisals from their stalkers. Victims often go to
extraordinary lengths to keep themselves safe, including:

o Changing all personal contact information such as phone and fax numbers,
postal and e-mail addresses, and driver's license and social security numbers. 

o Trying to restrict public access to their personal records such as getting their
names off all mailing lists and making sure companies and public agencies do
not give out their personal information.

o Getting devices that allow them to screen who has contact with them, such as
voice mail and caller I.D. boxes for telephones. 

o Changing their lifestyles and restricting their communication with others by, for
example, altering routines, discontinuing activities, switching jobs, finding new
schools for children, temporarily or permanently relocating, and ceasing
communication with family and friends.

----------------------------

One victim told of police officers being called to her home on numerous
occasions, listening to her accounts of being stalked, and taking written notes.
She found out only later that not one report had ever been officially filed.

Another victim said that she went to the police only after her stalker broke her
nose in broad daylight. They told her it would be too hard to prosecute her
case. She endured numerous attacks by the stalker after her initial interaction
with law enforcement, including one that left her hearing disabled.

One victim indicated that she received assistance from an FBI agent who got
involved in her case when the stalker started sending threatening letters to her
through the U.S. Postal Service. Prior to this intervention, however, she
endured years of increasingly violent stalking acts.

----------------------------

One victim spent approximately 2 years hiding from her stalker in basements of
people she knew, only going home every couple of days to feed her pets. Her
stalker eventually attempted to shoot her.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Victim Safety

The Address Confidentiality Program, coordinated by Washington's Secretary
of State Office, helps stalking, sexual assault, and domestic violence victims
maintain address confidentiality by offering them a substitute mailing address.
For more information, call 360-586-4386 or 360-586-4388 (TTY) (Olympia,
WA).

----------------------------

Emotional and Physiological Reactions

In addition to living in fear and paying constant attention to maintaining their
physical safety, victims may experience harmful responses from individuals and
institutions, such as the criminal justice system or their workplace. Many spoke
of having reactions common to the experiences of other survivors of trauma,
including:

o Powerlessness/loss of control. 

o Feelings of desperation and isolation. 

o Self-blame or shame.

o Hypervigilance and overreactivity. 

o Sleep disturbances such as nightmares and difficulty falling asleep or staying
awake. 

o Avoidance of intimacy. 

o Weight loss or gain.

o Substance abuse.

o Intense fear of specific and general things such as being alone or in crowds. 

o Anxiety and depression.


o Spiritual crises.

These descriptions by the focus group victims also support the findings of the
NVAW survey concerning the psychological and social consequences of
stalking. About one-third of the women surveyed said they sought
psychological counseling as a result of their stalking victimization.[16] The
report also showed that stalking victims were significantly more likely than
members of the general population to be very concerned about their personal
safety and about being stalked, to carry something to defend themselves, and to
think personal safety has gotten worse in recent years.[17] Numerous
advocates and service providers at the focus group meeting indicated that the
stalking victims they encounter often experience posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).

Lifetime Ordeal

The ongoing nature of the crime often makes it particularly difficult for victims to
recover from the effects of the stalking. While the victims participating in the
discussion were not currently being stalked, they all indicated that they live in
some degree of fear that the stalking will start anew. They expressed two
reasons for this fear:

o Even when the criminal justice system imprisons or institutionalizes stalkers, it
typically does not detain them forever.

o If victims successfully fled from their stalkers by relocating or changing their
identity, they are not fully confident that the stalkers will not eventually discover
their new location or identity.

----------------------------

One victim recounted that after serving a reduced jail sentence, the offender
resumed his stalking activities at a more frequent and violent level.

----------------------------

Secondary Victims

Participants stressed that stalking also affects secondary victims, such as
children and other family members, friends, co-workers, and other
acquaintances. These individuals can suffer because:

o They may become an object of the stalker's attacks as a way of controlling
the primary victim. 

o They may witness stalking acts against the primary victim. 

o They may be traumatized as they try to support the primary victim. 

o They may be affected indirectly as a result of the stalking (e.g., a friend misses
work in order to assist the victim, or children miss school because they are
fleeing the stalker). 

Participants were particularly concerned about the plight of children who
witness stalking or who are stalked themselves. A number of service providers
at the meeting expressed alarm that in situations where stalkers and victims have
children in common, courts sometimes require victims and their children to stay
in the same State as their stalkers.

Costs of Stalking to Victims 

Although there are no comprehensive nationwide data on the overall cost of
stalking, it was obvious from participant feedback that victims experience
enormous losses. The focus group cited several losses to victims that are
directly attributable to stalking: property damage and destruction, physical and
emotional injuries requiring short- and long-term medical and mental health
treatment, lost wages, expenditures related to hiding from the stalkers and
maintaining safety, and pain, suffering, and an overall reduced quality of life.

It can quickly become very costly for stalking victims to maintain safety and
health given the long-term nature of the crime and the multitude of tactics that
stalkers employ. However, the extensive financial assistance and/or resources
these victims require are simply not available in most communities. 

While many State crime compensation programs will cover some expenses
related to stalking (e.g., counseling), some States do not cover expenses unless
a violent incident has occurred. Most State programs do not cover the range of
victim expenses related to relocation, such as moving costs and lost wages.

----------------------------

As a consequence of stalking, one victim was fired from her job and forced to
declare bankruptcy.

----------------------------


The NVAW survey also addressed the cost of stalking. It reported that 26
percent of the stalking victims said their victimization caused them to lose time
from work. The survey authors attributed this lost time to the same reasons
identified by the focus group: to attend court hearings, meet with a psychologist
or other mental health professional, avoid contact with the assailant, and consult
with an attorney. Seven percent of the victims responding to the NVAW survey
said they never returned to work. For those victims who returned to work, the
average time missed due to their stalking victimization was 11 days.[18]

Professionals Who Can Help

Victims of stalking require a wide range of services from victim assistance
providers, victim advocates, justice system personnel, and other community
professionals. These service providers must:

o Validate that the stalking experienced by the victim is indeed occurring.

o Understand the complexity of the crime and the danger posed by stalkers.

o Have the capacity to provide effective intervention strategies that protect and
support victims and restrict stalkers. 

Service providers, victim advocates, and criminal justice personnel need to
provide immediate assistance to victims dealing with stalking. They must be
sensitive to the victim's need for confidentiality and ensure that information
pertaining to the victim is not released to a third party without the victim's
permission. After providing information on safety planning and resources, those
working with stalking victims need to respect and support the decisions victims
make concerning their own safety, even when they do not agree with victims'
decisions.[19]

Communities generally lack justice system personnel, victim assistance
providers, and advocates with sufficient knowledge or capacity to provide
specialized assistance for stalking victims, particularly for those who are being
stalked by strangers or acquaintances or through the Internet. The focus group
reported that other community professionals, such as doctors, mental health
providers, welfare and child protection workers, daycare providers, school
staff, employers, and church leaders, also lack knowledge about how to identify
and respond to stalking.

Response Tailored to Individual Circumstances

Victim experiences vary due to multiple factors, which must be taken into
account when developing effective responses to promote victim safety and
restrict the actions of stalkers. Specifically, victims emphasized that it is
important not to evaluate the stalker's behavior based on the victim's
relationship with the stalker. Instead, those working with stalking victims should
incorporate prior knowledge of each particular stalker with studied behavior
patterns of stalkers in general to develop a proper response. Because stalking
behavior is unpredictable, mechanisms must be in place to protect victims if and
when stalking escalates.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Individualized Response

In 1996, the Victim Services Stalking Unit of the Queens, New York, Criminal
Court Program received funding from the New York Crime Victims Board to
provide services to stalking victims, regardless of whether the victim was
physically injured in the course of the stalking crimes. The unit offers stalking
victims crisis intervention and emotional support, assistance with assessing risk
and safety planning, defense kits, instruction on keeping logs of evidence for
court, and legal advocacy and case management throughout the criminal justice
system. It also offers victims fact sheets, brochures, and tip cards, written in
both English and Spanish. For more information, call 718-286-6084 (Kew
Gardens, NY).

----------------------------

Many communities have justice system and victim assistance resources set up
to help domestic violence victims assess their risk of danger and plan for safety.
These resources may or may not be sufficient to help victims who are stalked
by partners or former partners. 

Underserved Populations of Victims

Stalking victims may face further obstacles to getting help because their
communities are not prepared to provide the individualized attention and
services they need, due to factors such as: 

o Physical, cognitive, or emotional disabilities.

o Language capacity. 

o Cultural and ethnic background.


o Socioeconomic status.

o Place of residence, such as a rural area or college campus.

o Gender.

o Sexual orientation.

o Immigration status.

o Religion.

o Race.

Agencies need specific training and technology to assist these victims
successfully. For example, victims with hearing disabilities need to be able to
communicate with others to get help. Assisting agencies should have TTY/TDD
machines and the capacity to use them, know how to use phone relay systems,
and have quick access to sign-language interpreters. Victims with a wide range
of experiences, resources, or capabilities need individuals with appropriate
sensitivities and cultural backgrounds to advocate for them, particularly in
interactions with agencies not equipped to deal with victims from diverse
communities.

Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

Focus group participants recounted several types of criminal justice
interventions that may be effective in maintaining victim safety and holding
offenders accountable. They include:

o Swift and timely law enforcement response.

o Dispatchers who address victim safety first and officers who make every
attempt to arrest stalkers.

o Investigation of each case thoroughly and aggressively with the goal of
charging stalkers with the fullest range of crimes possible.  

o Assistance for victims in assessing stalkers' potential lethality and developing
safety plans.

o Instruction for victims on how to document stalking activities and use
equipment to collect evidence such as an answering machine, tape recorder,
camera, or video camera.

o Helping victims obtain restraining orders or referring victims to advocates
who can assist them in obtaining restraining orders and a quick response to any
violations of these orders. 

o Aggressive prosecution and court responses that keep stalkers away from
victims after charges are filed, such as high bonds that may help keep stalkers
incarcerated before or during trials, or requests that no contact be a condition
of pretrial release.

o Providing victims with information about stalking crimes, legal remedies, and
referrals to community resources.

o Helping victims keep personal information confidential throughout criminal
justice proceedings (e.g., a stalker's attorney should not be able to obtain
information that the stalker can use to threaten or harass the victim). 

o Proactive prosecution and court responses that involve effective strategies to
deter stalkers from further acts of stalking and to protect victims, such as the
electronic monitoring of stalkers as part of sentencing. 

o Notifying victims of stalkers' pending release from correctional or mental
facilities and the conditions of their probation, along with assistance in
post-release safety planning and protection.

Promising Practice: Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

The Dover, New Hampshire, Police Department recently received an Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant to establish an
antistalking unit and develop antistalking countermeasures. The
countermeasures will comprise the following: vertical investigation and
prosecution, streamlined investigation methods and use of technology to
enhance investigations, use of global positioning satellite technology to monitor
offenders, and development of victim safety strategies, including assistance with
relocation. To coordinate victim relocation, the unit will partner with one or
more agencies to help victims maintain safety during transitions to their new
locations. For more information, call 603-743-6140.

----------------------------


Some justice agencies and professionals have developed creative strategies to
combat stalking and help victims maintain their safety. However, many criminal
justice agencies lack the capacity to provide the comprehensive protection
needed by stalking victims, often due to a lack of effective antistalking laws or
agency protocols addressing stalking. There is also a general lack of
understanding about the seriousness of the issue. Gaps in responses, such as
incorrectly charging stalking crimes and failing to enforce restraining orders
against stalkers, can result in increased danger for victims.

Other barriers to effective criminal justice system intervention include stalker
manipulation of the justice system and heavy evidence collection burdens on
victims. For example, some stalkers successfully shift attention away from
themselves by claiming that victims are stalking them or by accusing victims of
child abuse or neglect. At the same time, they continue to stalk the victims.
Moreover, realizing their cases will not go forward in the criminal justice system
without sufficient evidence, many victims spend a lot of time and energy keeping
detailed logs of stalking incidents and collecting supporting documentation. In
fact, in order to obtain evidence that the crime of stalking has been committed,
victims often have to endure more stalking acts.

----------------------------

One participant said that stalking is one of the few crimes where victims who
want their cases to go forward are cast as their own investigators and required
to do things that professionals usually do.

----------------------------

In order to pursue justice system remedies, stalking victims often meet with
investigators and prosecutors, gather evidence, fill out paperwork, petition the
court for protection orders, and testify against stalkers. They may have to miss
work and lose wages, provide for childcare, and find transportation. Not only
does justice system involvement often present financial and logistical problems
for victims, it also may increase the danger they face. Stalkers may try to make
contact with victims as they travel to and from government buildings. Many
victims view incarceration of their stalker as a temporary reprieve and are
consumed by fear of their offenders' pending release. For some victims,
however, even incarceration fails to end the violence; their stalkers continue to
terrorize them from prisons or mental institutions by sending them threatening
letters. 

Assistance and Advocacy for All Victims


Although it is imperative that the criminal justice system provide stalking victims
with support, information, and advocacy throughout criminal proceedings,
victims also need nonlegal resources and assistance to maintain their safety,
such as: 

o Confidential emergency shelter for victims who are in immediate danger. 

o Crime-specific crisis intervention and support for victims, family, and friends.

o Assistance in cutting off stalkers' access to information about victims.

o Access to safety-enhancing equipment such as cell phones and body alarms.

o Help in protecting children and other dependents from stalkers, including
representation in family courts to revoke stalkers' custody rights. 

As long as they feel any risk, victims need ongoing advocacy and assistance
with planning for their safety, as well as access to resources to implement their
plans. Some victims may feel so endangered that they are compelled to make
significant changes to hide from their stalkers, such as altering their identity or
relocating to another area, and will need comprehensive assistance similar to
that provided through witness protection programs.

Chapter 4
State Stalking Legislation Update--1998, 1999, and 2000 Sessions

States have enacted stalking legislation increasingly in each of the past 3 years.
In part, this reflects a growing understanding of the impact of stalking behavior.
New legislative topics are being addressed today that were not foreseeable
when legislators first addressed stalking crimes 10 years ago. The 3-year
review below summarizes stalking legislation from 1998 to 2000. It does not
include final information from about 12 legislatures that were still in session
when this review was completed in August 2000.

In 1998, the 44 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 150 new laws directed at violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 11 States passed laws amending their stalking and related criminal
laws, including 2 States that passed new stalking injunction laws (see table 1).
In 1999, the 49 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 300 laws relating to violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 26 States passed laws related to stalking (see table 2). By August
2000, 20 of the 44 State legislatures in session had enacted 27 stalking related
laws (see table 3). Overall, fewer than 200 enactments in the 2000 legislative
year addressed violence against women issues.[20]

Many other laws directed at helping victims of domestic violence also may
apply when stalking behavior is related to domestic violence. For example, laws
requiring that a jurisdiction give full faith and credit to other jurisdictions'
protection orders may apply either to orders prohibiting stalking as an element
of domestic violence or to antistalking orders. Similarly, laws providing
confidentiality for victims of domestic violence may be used by stalking victims
when the stalker is a current or former intimate partner under the State
domestic violence law. Hence, this list of new laws is not all inclusive.

The new laws explicitly directed at stalking behavior primarily change either the
definition of or the penalty for stalking or authorize courts to issue antistalking
protection orders. Other new laws authorize arrest of misdemeanor stalkers
and prohibit firearm possession when an antistalking order has been issued. 

Stalking and Related Cases: 1990-2000

Challenges to State Antistalking Laws

Although it has been only 10 years since the first stalking law was enacted, the
passage of these laws in all 50 States has sparked considerable litigation over
their constitutionality and scope. In reviewing and interpreting stalking laws,
courts often have drawn on cases involving similar penal statutes--those
criminalizing harassment and those involving threats.[21] These laws not only
deal with related behavior, but they also use the kind of terms and phrases
(e.g., annoy, repeatedly) that may be the subject of legal attack by defendants.
Thus, analysis of stalking laws must examine all three types of criminal laws and
statutes covering threats and harassment by telephone.

This review identified 464 State and 17 Federal stalking and related cases in
which challenges to antistalking and related laws were addressed.[22] Among
these were a total of 157 stalking cases, including 2 Federal cases. The stalking
cases involved predominantly constitutional challenges (124 cases in 34 States
and the District of Columbia), typically based on vagueness, overbreadth, and
related First Amendment issues. The review also looked at the relationship
between the stalker and the victim in cases in which the relevant statutes were
challenged. This review found that 56 of the 129 stalking cases for which
relationship information was available involved nonintimate partners. This
category included 14 cases involving stranger stalking; the other nonpartner
cases covered relationships such as neighbors, ex-employees,
psychiatrist-patient, judge-litigant, and landlord-tenant. In 38 cases, the
perpetrator had a dating relationship with the victim, including several in which
the perpetrator cohabited with the victim. In many states, stalking against a
former dating partner can be classified as domestic violence for the purpose of
obtaining a court order of protection. In 35 cases, the perpetrators stalked
former wives from whom they were divorced or separated. Almost all of the
reported cases in which statutes were challenged involved male stalkers.

----------------------------

Among the stalking-related cases, 56 involved harassment and 100 involved
threats. These cases were selected for review because they involved either an
important legal question with implications for interpretation of the stalking law at
issue or a situation similar to stalking in which questions of sufficiency of the
evidence affected the court decision. In 41 of the harassment cases and 36 of
the threat cases, the defendant raised constitutional challenges. There were 43
harassment and 64 threat cases involving statutory construction issues. Many of
the 56 harassment cases raised constitutional and statutory construction issues.

Other types of cases covered by this review included 20 telephone threat
cases, 85 telephone harassment cases, 8 letter threat or harassment cases, and
6 electronic threat or harassment cases. In addition, 47 cases involved
protection orders, typically stalking charges related to violation of a protection
order. Three cases involved civil suits for damages based on civil stalking laws
or some other invasion of privacy. Among these cases were 87 constitutional
law decisions and 51 statutory construction decisions. There were also five
cases in which defendants raised jurisdictional or other constitutional challenges
to Federal laws.

The list of cases in appendix A does not necessarily include all relevant
reported cases, although a significant effort was made to identify such
cases.[23] The review excluded reported decisions that involved solely
evidentiary issues where no constitutional or statutory interpretation issues were
decided.[24] Threat and harassment cases that were totally unrepresentative of
stalking concerns also were excluded, while included, for example, were threats
and verbal abuse of police officers.[25] 

In general, court decisions reviewed here measured constitutional challenges
based on overbreadth by whether the law prohibits acts rather than speech and
by whether it contains an intent to cause a specified harm. Vagueness claims
generally were evaluated based on whether the harmful acts barred by the law
are of such specificity that an ordinary person would not fail to understand what
is prohibited. Therefore, statutes that criminalize acts that include an intent to
cause harm as an element of the offense were most likely to pass constitutional
muster. This finding is consistent with the precepts underlying the Model
Anti-Stalking Code,[26] which limits its scope to acts that create a fear of
serious injury and include an intent component. 

The review in appendix A identifies each case by the name of the litigants, type
of law involved, and case citation and gives a brief summary of the court's
decision. Court rulings apply only to the specific statutory language used in the
case before the court. Thus, while there may be general agreement among the
courts within a State on a particular legal issue, such an agreement may not be
relevant to the language used in a particular State statute. With this important
caveat, review of the cases suggests the following:

1. Most stalking statutes meet constitutional minimums. Inclusion of an intent
requirement resolves most vagueness challenges. However, the use of terms
such as "annoy" or "alarm" without limiting definitions makes a law vulnerable to
challenge on the basis that it is unconstitutionally vague. Statutes have been
upheld that establish a rebuttable presumption of intent where there is evidence
that the victim requested that the stalking conduct end. Most statutes require
that the prohibited acts include a threat component, that the defendant intend to
cause or know of the victim's fear of death or serious injury and that the victim's
fear be reasonable.

2.  A finding of contempt for a violation of a protection order does not
generally prevent a second prosecution for the substantive stalking offense on
double jeopardy grounds. Some courts may require, however, that the acts
constituting stalking be different from those underlying the charge of violating the
order. There is no agreement among the courts that evidence of a prior
restraining order may be admitted to show the defendant's intent or course of
action, but a prior order may be used to show victim fear. Courts differ on
whether a collateral attack may be permitted on the validity of a court order in
protection order violation proceedings.


3. Harassment laws are vulnerable to a constitutional challenge where the
prohibited speech is not limited to "fighting words." "Fighting words" refers to
language that is likely to lead to a physical confrontation. Such language is
entitled to less protection under the First Amendment.

4. It is permissible for threat laws that include a reasonable fear requirement to
equate reckless behavior by the perpetrator with intent to cause reasonable fear
for the victim. In some States, actual terror is not required, merely that fear
would be reasonable under the circumstances and that there is an intent to
terrorize. An intent to carry out the threat is not an element of the crime, and
physical acts alone may constitute a threat. The absence in most States of
statutory language defining stalking to include implied threats is made even more
significant by the lack of court rulings in many of these same States interpreting
threat laws to include implied or conditional threats.

5. Harassment and threat laws apply to communications delivered through
third parties where such delivery may be reasonably anticipated or intended.

6. Telephone harassment and threat laws usually focus on the intent of the
caller, not the response of the person called, because invasion of privacy is an
implicit second element of the crime. Intent must be complemented by proof of
harassment or threatening acts. A law barring intent alone without regard to the
actual contents of the communication will be overbroad. A few courts do,
however, require that victim fear result from a telephone threat, depending on
the specific language of the statute involved. Courts also are split on whether
harassing intent must be the sole purpose of the communication or may coexist
with legitimate motives for the communication.

7. Prosecution of electronic harassment by fax, Internet, citizen band radio, or
other means may require specific statutory language prohibiting the use of these
medias to harass.

8. Jurisdiction or venue lies in the locality or State where a non-face-to-face
threat or harassment communication is received. Jurisdiction also may lie in the
location from which the communication was sent.

9. Intrastate communication that involves interstate intermediaries to deliver
the message confers Federal jurisdiction over the crime where a Federal statute
applies to the conduct.

In the first 10 years since stalking has been criminalized, most courts have
recognized the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting citizens against
stalking. Accordingly, courts generally have affirmed the constitutionality of
antistalking legislation when weighed against First Amendment concerns.


However, a number of courts have struck down related laws that lack specific
fighting words requirements to narrow their scope. Courts also are beginning to
accommodate legal complications often resulting from the repetitive nature of
the stalking crime, in some cases allowing separate prosecutions for protection
order violations and substantive offenses. However, there is no broad
agreement across jurisdictions that these offenses may be tried separately
without raising double jeopardy concerns.

Unfortunately, at least two major gaps remain in States' legislative initiatives
against stalking and their interpretations by the courts. State legislatures and
courts frequently fail to recognize implied or conditional threats in their
construction of the stalking crime. Stalkers who follow, repeatedly contact, and
otherwise terrorize their victims in a persistent and even obsessive manner may
slip through the cracks of the criminal justice system if they refrain from spelling
out their threats. Such legislative loopholes need to be addressed.

In addition, current stalking legislation lacks explicit bars to harassment via
electronic media such as telephones, fax machines, e-mail, and the Internet. By
and large, courts are not interpreting older legislation to cover recently
developed communications technologies. Such narrow interpretation of
antistalking codes does not cover cyberstalking and other modes of high-tech
terrorization. Thus, many States may need to enact specific legislative bans on
the use of such media for stalking purposes. When use of these communications
technologies crosses State lines, however, courts have agreed that Federal
jurisdiction is conferred. To date, prosecution under Federal laws may have
been more successful than State prosecution in bringing high-tech stalkers to 
justice.

Chapter 5 
Federal Prosecutions

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) made it a Federal offense
to cross State or tribal lines to commit domestic violence or to violate a
protection order.[27] It is also a Federal offense to possess a firearm while
under a domestic violence protection order or if convicted of a misdemeanor
crime of domestic violence.[28] Although the vast majority of domestic violence
cases continue to be prosecuted at the State, local, and tribal levels, these
statutory tools enable Federal law enforcement to prosecute certain cases in
cooperation with the local authorities.

A Federal interstate stalking law, 18 U.S.C. ss 2261A, was enacted in 1996.
This statute prohibited individuals from traveling across a State line with the
intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of or as a result of
that travel, placing that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious
bodily injury to, that person or a member of that person's immediate family. The
statute also criminalized the same conduct within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States regardless of whether a State line was
crossed. Courts may sentence offenders to 10 years if the offense results in
serious bodily injury to the victim or if the offender uses a dangerous weapon,
20 years if permanent disfigurement or life-threatening bodily injury results, and
a life sentence if death of the victim results.

The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (VAWA 2000) amended the
Federal interstate stalking law to include travel across State and national
boundaries, as well as travel into or out of Indian country and within the special
maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.[29] VAWA 2000 also
expanded the Federal statute to cover certain travel or conduct with the intent
to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, whereas the law originally
covered only the intent to injure or harass. Moreover, it is now a violation of
Federal law to place the victim in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious
bodily injury to, the victim's current or former intimate partner. Finally, the new
statute criminalizes the use of the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign
commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places the victim in reasonable
fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, the victim, a member of the
victim's immediate family, or a spouse or intimate partner of the victim. This
new provision covers cyberstalking in which the perpetrator and the victim are
in different States or tribal jurisdictions or within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The penalties for the Federal stalking
offenses remain the same as those enacted in 1996.

Vigorous prosecution of the VAWA and VAWA-related offenses is a top
priority for the Justice Department. After passage of these laws, the
Department asked each U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) to designate a Point of
Contact for the prosecution of the Federal domestic violence and stalking laws.
In 1997, the Office for Victims of Crime funded a position of VAWA Specialist
assigned to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) to focus
exclusively on training and technical assistance for the VAWA Points of
Contact and victim witness coordinators on the prosecution of Federal
domestic violence and stalking cases. The position, originally funded for a year,
was extended for a second year. In November 1998, EOUSA created a
permanent VAWA Specialist position, in full recognition of the importance of
these cases and the continuing need for training and technical assistance.

These prosecution efforts have been successful because the USAOs have
forged partnerships with their State, local, and tribal counterparts, allowing
USAOs to bring Federal cases where appropriate. As of October 2000, the
Justice Department had prosecuted 35 cases against 39 stalkers under the
interstate stalking provision and had won convictions of 25 defendants in 23
cases (11 cases were still pending disposition as of that date).[30] In all but 1
of the 35 cases, the stalker was male. In one case, the male stalker had a
female accomplice, and in another the stalker's mother and father were his
accomplices. In 34 of the 35 cases, the victim was female, and in 27 cases the
stalker and victim were current or former intimate partners. Three cases
involved workplace stalking. As of October 2000, 18 defendants have been
sentenced and 7 are awaiting sentencing.

In the 14 sentences handed down since March 1998, the penalties have ranged
from 13 months and supervised release to life imprisonment. Defendants
pleaded guilty in 10 of these cases. In one case, in which the defendant was
sentenced to 13 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release, he
also was ordered to pay restitution and to have no contact with the victim. The
next highest sentence included an upward departure by the judge, which
resulted in 21 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release. In
another case, the defendant received a 22-month sentence and was ordered to
pay the victim $7,000, which included moving costs the victim incurred trying to
escape the stalking. Another defendant was sentenced to 60 months of
incarceration and 3 years of supervised release for interstate violation of a
protection order, interstate stalking, and arson. Other sentences included
consecutive sentences on 4 stalking counts totaling 20 years and 4 life
sentences (including 1 consecutive life sentence) for a defendant who stalked,
kidnapped, shot, and murdered the victim.

Case Examples

The following are examples of cases that have been prosecuted under the
Federal interstate stalking statute.

The USAO for the Western District of Texas prosecuted a defendant who
traveled from Alabama to Texas, where he terrorized his ex-wife and three
grown sons. The defendant, who had been in Federal custody in Alabama for
making interstate threatening phone calls to another ex-wife, traveled to Texas
after he lost custody of a minor child. At sentencing, the court considered the
defendant's lengthy history of abusing the 4 stalking victims--a history that
included beatings, torture, abandonment, threats to kill, stabbing, and burning--
and departed upward from the sentencing guidelines to impose the maximum
sentence of 20 years.

In a case prosecuted in the Eastern District of North Carolina, the defendant,
who previously had been verbally abusive toward his wife, assaulted and
threatened to kill her while she was visiting him in the State where he was
studying to receive a license to practice medicine. When she returned to their
home State, he continued to threaten her over the telephone, and he arrived at
her home one day after threatening to kill her. He was sentenced to 22 months
and was ordered to pay the victim $7,000 in restitution.

In another case, the defendant had been convicted in Nevada of assaulting his
wife and had served a 6-month sentence for the offense. After his release from
prison, he called the victim in California and threatened that he would come
after her and would destroy her car. While subject to a protection order in
Nevada, he traveled to California and set fire to his wife's car. He was
sentenced to 60 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release.

Another defendant, who had been abusing his wife for several years, threatened
to kill her sister, who was a police officer in a neighboring State. He also
threatened to kill a man whom he accused of being involved with his wife. The
day after he made these threats, the defendant was found approximately a
quarter mile from the home of his wife's sister, armed with a revolver and an
automatic weapon. He has been convicted of interstate stalking and awaits
sentencing.

In a case prosecuted in the District of Maine, the defendant, after losing
custody of his children, traveled to the State where his wife, from whom he was
separated, was living. An accomplice lured his wife's brother and boyfriend out
of the house, and the defendant killed them both. He and his accomplice then
kidnapped his wife and drove her to New York where they were found in a
motel room. The defendant was convicted of interstate domestic violence,
interstate stalking, kidnapping, and interstate violation of a protection order. He
received a life sentence.

Another defendant forced his wife to travel from Florida to Kentucky, where he
and an accomplice sexually assaulted her. He also harassed his wife, obtained
false arrest warrants for her, and posted signs seeking information on her
whereabouts and offering a reward for any such information. The defendant
was convicted at trial of interstate domestic violence, interstate violation of a
protection order, and interstate stalking. At sentencing, the judge departed
upward and sentenced the defendant to 87 months in prison and 3 years of
supervised release.


Conclusion

The Federal antistalking statute is a valuable tool for prosecuting cases where
the interstate nature of the offense may complicate effective State investigation
and prosecution. U.S. Attorneys can prosecute cases that they could not
pursue previously unless the case met the elements of the VAWA offenses for
crossing State or tribal lines to commit domestic violence or violation of a
protection order. 

While the interstate stalking law was not intended to supplant State and local
prosecution of stalking crimes, the Federal Government has an important role to
play in supplementing State and local efforts. In some cases, a Federal
prosecution may carry a more severe and appropriate punishment for an
offender than a prosecution under a similar State law. If a defendant has
traveled from State to State, local law enforcement officials may have difficulty
gathering evidence. Federal prosecution is not as problematic because of the
nationwide resources of the FBI. In other cases, a State prosecutor may
request that the case be referred for Federal prosecution because, once
detained by a Federal court, a defendant is more likely to remain in custody
prior to trial.

The Justice Department is committed to prosecuting cases under the VAWA
and VAWA-related statutes and to building partnerships with State, local, and
tribal counterparts. These efforts include sponsorship of and participation in
local and regional conferences addressing the dynamics of domestic violence,
prosecution of domestic violence cases, and training on the Federal domestic
violence and stalking laws. The audiences for these training conferences and
workshops have included State, local, and tribal law enforcement, prosecutors,
judges, victim advocates, and Federal law enforcement. While recognizing that
outreach extends beyond the traditional role of USAOs, the Justice Department
supports these efforts to ensure a Federal presence in interstate stalking and
domestic violence cases. Referrals of Federal cases have come from police
officers, district attorneys, shelter workers, victim advocates, and others who
come in contact with domestic violence and stalking victims. In addition, this
outreach will continue to include representatives of the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The readiness of Federal law enforcement to
respond to case referrals and to investigate and prosecute stalking cases is
critical to our efforts.

The Violence Against Women Office, EOUSA and its VAWA Specialist, and
the rest of the Justice Department will continue to support USAOs in education
and training efforts in their jurisdictions and in prosecution of cases under the
Federal domestic violence and stalking laws.

Attorney General's Report to the Vice President, U.S. Department of Justice,
August 1999.

3 Statutes that require a showing of a credible threat may be problematic in the
prosecution of stalking cases. Stalkers often do not threaten their victims overtly
or in person; rather, they engage in conduct that, when taken in context, would
cause a reasonable person to fear violence. In the context of cyberstalking, a
credible threat requirement would be even more problematic because the
stalker, sometimes unknown to the victim, may be located a great distance
away and, therefore, the threat might not be considered credible. The better
approach, codified in the Federal interstate stalking statute, 18 U.S.C. ss
2261A, is to prohibit conduct that places a person in reasonable fear of death
or bodily injury.

Stalking Victimization in a National Study of College Women." (From a
forthcoming report on sexual violence against college women funded by the
U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice).

6 The information was gathered through informal surveys of State attorneys
general, USAOs, and, to a lesser extent, local prosecutors' offices. Victim
accounts were given voluntarily through outreach conducted by the Violence
Against Women Office of the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, the
American Prosecutors Research Institute of the National District Attorneys
Association compiled a report with background information on cyberstalking,
which provided valuable information on current law enforcement efforts. 

7 These States are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. Arkansas and Maryland
have enacted statutes that cover harassment via electronic communications
outside their stalking statutes.

8 "Telecommunications device" excludes interactive computer services to
insulate the service provider from liability but not to insulate an individual user
from liability for his or her criminal behavior. Accordingly, the Justice
Department successfully argued that a modem was a telecommunications
device within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, an individual who uses a
modem to connect to the Internet and harass an individual is likely to fall within
the terms of the statute. See American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 929 F.
Supp. 824, 829 n.5 (E.D. Penn. 1996), aff'd, 521 U.S. 844 (1997);

20 This information was gathered from government Web sites, commercial
legislative reporters, and telephone interviews with selected State legislative
research bureau staff. Neal Miller of the Institute for Law and Justice
conducted the study.

21 Criminal laws involving threats include intimidation and extortion statutes,
which involve threats as punishment for past and future acts. Excluded from this
review are cases prosecuted under these related laws where the facts show
behavior totally unrelated to stalking. See, e.g., Coates v. City of Cincinnati,

unpublished decisions that were available at a State court Web site were
included where relevant according to the criteria stated above.

23 The most significant omission is the exclusion of most decisions prior to
1970 on the assumption that the older cases are largely repetitive of more
recent decisions. 

24 See, e.g., Soldona v. State, 466 S.E.2d 655 (Ga. Ct. App. 1996)
(insufficient evidence claim) and People v. Garrett, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (Ct.
App. 1994) (evidence admissibility challenge). See also Kirkendoll v. State,
945 S.W.2d 400 (Ark. Ct. App. 1997) (defendant charged with stalking
claimed failure of waiver of right to counsel in pro se defense).

25 See, e.g., Robinson v. State, 615 So.2d 112 (Ala. Ct. Crim. App. 1992).
Other examples of excluded cases include People v. Thomas, 148 Cal. Rptr.
52 (Ct. App. 1978) (threat against witness testifying at future trial) and People
v. Mirmirani, 178 Cal. Rptr. 172 (1982) (political terrorism threat).

27 Violence Against Women Act of 1994 ss 40231, 18 U.S.C. ssss 2261,
2262. These provisions also prohibit causing a spouse or intimate partner to
cross State or tribal lines by force, coercion, duress, or fraud and, in the course
of or as a result of such conduct, committing domestic violence or violating a
protection order. 

28 See 18 U.S.C. ss 922(g)(8)-(9).

29 Violence Against Women Act of 2000 ss 1107, 18 U.S.C. ss 2261A.

30 In one case, the defendant was convicted of assault under 18 U.S.C. ss 113
but was acquitted on the interstate stalking charge. In another case, the
defendant was placed in pretrial diversion.
