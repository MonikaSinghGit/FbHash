ted offenses is a top
priority for the Justice Department. After passage of these laws, the
Department asked each U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) to designate a Point of
Contact for the prosecution of the Federal domestic violence and stalking laws.
In 1997, the Office for Victims of Crime funded a position of VAWA Specialist
assigned to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) to focus

Justice Department had prosecuted 35 cases against 39 stalkers under the
interstate stalking provision and had won convictions of 25 defendants in 23
cases (11 cases were still pending disposition as of that date).[30] In all but 1
of the 35 cases, the stalker was male. In one case, the male stalker had a
female accomplice, and in another the stalker's mother and father were his
accomplices. In 34 of the 35 cases, the victim was female, and in 27 cases the
stalker and victim were current or former intimate partners. Three cases
involved workplace stalking. As of October 2000, 18 defendants have been
sentenced and 7 are awaiting sentencing.

In the 14 sentences handed down since March 1998, the penalties have ranged
from 13 months and supervised release to life imprisonment. Defendants
pleaded guilty in 10 of these cases. In one case, in which
