ty
professionals. These service providers must:

o Validate that the stalking experienced by the victim is indeed occurring.

o Understand the complexity of the crime and the danger posed by stalkers.

o Have the capacity to provide effective intervention strategies that protect and
support victims and restrict stalkers. 

Service providers, victim advocates, and criminal justice personnel need to
provide immediate assistance to victims dealing with stalking. They must be
sensitive to the victim's need for confidentiality and ensure that information
pertaining to the victim is not released to a third party without the victim's
permission. After providing information on safety planning and resources, those
working with stalking victims need to respect and support the decisions victims
make concerning their own safety, even when they do not agree with victims'
decisions.[19]

Communities generally lack justice system personnel, victim assistance
providers, and advocates with sufficient knowledge or capacity to provide
specialized assistance for stalking victims, particularly for those who are being
stalked by strangers or acquaintances or through the Internet. The focus group
reported that other community professionals, such as doctors, mental health
providers, welfare and child protection workers, daycare providers, school
staff, employers, and church leaders, also lack knowledge about how to identify
and respond to stalking.

Response Tailored to Individual Circumstances

Victim experiences vary due to multiple factors, which must be taken into
account when developing effective responses to promote victim safety and
restrict the actions of stalkers. Specifically, victims emphasized that it is
important not to evaluate the stalker's behavior based on the victim's
relationship with the stalker. Instead, those working with stalking victims should
incorporate prior knowledge of each particular stalker with studied behavior
patterns of stalkers in general to develop a proper response. Because stalking
behavior is unpredictable, mechanisms must be in place to protect victims if and
when stalking escalates.

Promising Practice: Individualized Response

In 1996, the Victim Services Stalking Unit of the Queens, New York, Criminal
Court Program received funding from the New York Crime Victims Board to
provide services to stalking victims, regardless of whether the victim was
physically injured in the course of the stalking crimes. The unit offers stalking
victims crisis intervention and emotional support, assistance with assessing risk
and safety planning, defense kits, instruction on keeping logs of evidence for
court, and legal advocacy and case management throughout the criminal justice
system. It also offers victims fact sheets, brochures, and tip cards, written in
both English and Spanish. For more information, call 718-286-6084 (Kew
Gardens, NY).

Many communities have justice system and victim assistance resources set up
to help domestic violence victims assess their risk of danger and plan for safety.
These resources may or may not be sufficient to help victims who are stalked
by partners or former partners. 

Underserved Populations of Victims

Stalking victims may face further obstacles to getting help because their
communities are not prepared to provide the individualized attention and
services they need, due to factors such as: 

o Physical, cognitive, or emotional disabilities.

o Language capacity. 

o Cultural and ethnic background.


o Socioeconomic status.

o Place of residence, such as a rural area or college campus.

o Gender.

o Sexual orientation.

o Immigration status.

o Religion.

o Race.

Agencies need specific training and technology to assist these victims
successfully. For example, victims with hearing disabilities need to be able to
communicate with others to get help. Assisting agencies should have TTY/TDD
machines and the capacity to use them, know how to use phone relay systems,
and have quick access to sign-language interpreters. Victims with a wide range
of experiences, resources, or capabilities need individuals with appropriate
sensitivities and cultural backgrounds to advocate for them, particularly in
interactions with agencies not equipped to deal with victims from diverse
communities.

Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

Focus group participants recounted several types of criminal justice
interventions that may be effective in maintaining victim safety and holding
offenders accountable. They include:

o Swift and timely law enforcement response.

o Dispatchers who address victim safety first and officers who make every
attempt to arrest stalkers.

o Investigation of each case thoroughly and aggressively with the goal of
charging stalkers with the fullest range of crimes possible.  

o Assistance for victims in assessing stalkers' potential lethality and developing
safety plans.

o Instruction for victims on how to document stalking activities and use
equipment to collect evidence such as an answering machine, tape recorder,
camera, or video camera.

o Helping victims obtain restraining orders or referring victims to advocates
who can assist them in obtaining restraining orders and a quick response to any
violations of these orders. 

o Aggressive prosecution and court responses that keep stalkers away from
victims after charges are filed, such as high bonds that may help keep stalkers
incarcerated before or during trials, or requests that no contact be a condition
of pretrial release.

o Providing victims with information about stalking crimes, legal remedies, and
referrals to com
