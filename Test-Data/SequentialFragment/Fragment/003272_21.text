2 F.2d at 1348-1349 (defendant'sabsence from courtroom while the trial court formulated a response toa query from the jury not reversible error because defense counsel waspresent, no objection was made, and the outcome of the trial was notlikely affected).  Silverstein differs from the instant case in thatthe proceeding from which the defendants were absent was a conferencebetween trial court and counsel on an issue of law.  Such conferencesare expressly permitted to be held in the absence of the defendantunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(3), and the convictions in Silversteincould have been affirmed on that ground.   /31/ In Rushen, the only issue was whether an assumed violation ofthe right to be present at trial was subject to a "harmless error"analysis.  Here, the question is whether criminal defendants will bepermitted to remain silent at trial, and then obtain reversal ofconvictions on the basis of insubstantial claims of prejudice.  Thedisruptive effect of the decision below could be significant.   APPENDIX
