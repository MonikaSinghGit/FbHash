CALIFORNIA BEAN MARKET SUMMARY

    DEALER MARKET:  Trading activity was slow.   Demand light.  All classes traded 
at mostly steady prices with limited movement.
    GROWER MARKET:  Trading activity was slow.   Demand light to moderate.  All 
classes were steady on limited grower selling.  The lack of moisture either in the 
form of rain or snow has many growers concerned and causing them to be hesitant to 
commit.
