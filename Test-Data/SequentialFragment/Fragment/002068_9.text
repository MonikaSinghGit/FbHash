                   A Board of Schools of Radiation Therapy Technology, American Medical
                   Association Council of Medical Education was established December 1,
                   1968.  Applicants for admission to approved schools must be
                   graduates of approved schools of radiology technology, RNs with a
                   course in radiation physics or such equivalent that is acceptable

                 to the American Registry of Radiology Technology.  Minimum training
                 required is 12 mo nths.  There are approximately 6 approved schools with
                 6 others pending action.

                 Other Federal     ort

                 The Cancer Control Program, Division of Chronic Diseases, has
                 supported ten training programs in radiation therapy technology
                 for about three years.  Beginning in FY 1968, funding authority
                 for these grants was transferred to Comprehensive Health Planning
                 Program of Cor@miunity Health Service, under the authority of
                 Section 314(3) of the Public Health Servi-ce-Act.  As in the case
                 of cytotechnology training, there will be no allocation of funds
                 for these projects beyond the end of FY 1969.

            Recommendation

            DRMP staff recommends the following criteria be considered by National
            Advisory Council regarding DRMP support of basic training in established
            allied health professions.  A health profession will be considered
            established if a Board of Schools, American Medical Association Council
            on Medical Education, has been set up to approve schools, define standards
            for admission, curriculum requirements and certification procedures.

                    Relevance of the training activity to regional medical
                    programs, i. e. categorical  and public health relevance.
                    Training in nuclear medicine technology, radiation therapy
                    technology and inhalation therapy would thus have greater
                    significance for regional medical programs than training
                    of medical records librarians or orthopedic assistants,
                    for example.

                    Number of training opportunities available to meet
                    training needs.  In the case of cytotechnblogy training
                    the current number of training programs is.believed to
                    be adequate to meet the needs.  This is not so in some
                    areas of the country for inhalation therapy,and in most areas
                    of the country for nuclear medicine and radiation therapy
                    technology training.

            The above criteria are to be used in addition to, not as a substitute
            for, those outlined by the National Advisory Council for basic training
            of Allied Health professions.  (See NID, May 13, 1969, p.4)

            Alsoi as stated previously, regions are encouraged to use professional
            staff assistance and support of special planning studies to provide
            new educational and training opportunities in new and established allied
            health professions when needed.

            General Background Information             ther Feder     )i)ort

            a.   The Allied Health Professions Personnel Training Act provides
                 Basic Improvement (formula) Grants for only those professions
                 specifically listed in the legislation.  Therefore, nuclear
                 medicine technology and others which were not I'sted do not
                                                                1
                 qualify for this support.  They could qualify under the Act's
                 Developmental Grants but funds are severely limited.
             b.  In general, State Department of Education funds are awarded
                 only to educational institutions.  Vocational education funds,
                .therefore, go to vocational-technical area schools, junior and
                 community colleges, technical institutes and four-.year colleges
                 and universities under an approved State plan.  The 1968 Amendments
                 to the Vocational Education Act of 1963 expands the-activities
                 and increases the authorization for State grant programs.  States are
                 now required to spend at least 15% of their basic allotment for
                 the disadvantaged.  The amendments also stress that no less than
                 15% of funds available for State vocational educational programs
                 sball be used for post secondary vocational education.
                 The House of Representatives, U.S. Congress has now voted
                 to increase Federal appropriations to the States to look at
                 their educational- needs and to supply the training to meet those
                 n eeds.  Further increases in the number of allied health training
                 programs should, logically, follow if local areas make their
                 needs known to the State Departments of Education.
             c.  The occupational Training Programs, Manpower Development and
                 Training Act is co-administered by the Department of Labor and
                 HEW and emphasizes training programs for the unemployed and
                 underemployed.  State plans should provide for 2/3 of NDTA basic
                 program enrollees to be disadvantaged individuals.
                 During fiscal year 1970, the Manpower Administration will encourage
                 programs that include training for new occupations to relieve more
                 highly skilled personnel of routine duties, upgrading existing
                 personnel such as nurses aides to LP@ls, training in connection with
                 development of career ladders and training which may assist in
                 reducing turnover.
             d.  There now exists throughout the country Cooperative Area Manpower
                 Planning Systems Committees in each area.  CAMS is an interagency
                 effort with representatives from the Departments of Labor; Health,
                 Education, and Welfare; Office of Economic Opportunity; Agriculture;
                 Commerce; Housing and Urban Development; Interior and Civil Service
                 Commission to identify manpower problems in an area, delineate
                 resources and develop linkages between pro@rams.
                                                           C>

                 Division staff recommends that regions be given information
                 concerning CAYLPS so that manpower programs car, be coordinated
                 with them.  Upon request, the Department of Labor has agreed to

                compile a list of the Chairmen of all of the C@TS committees
                throughout the country which will be made available to the Division.
