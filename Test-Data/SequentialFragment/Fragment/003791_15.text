s were stated as greater than a high value, while the latest weekly area survey
                         showed all areas surveyed to be a factor of ten less than this.  The area survey
had not
                         been signed by a supervisor as required by the form.

       (c)               The General Instructions section of a maintenance procedure includes the
following
                         statement:  "Action steps in Section 5 TASK INSTRUCTIONS are for guidance
                         and are NOT intended to be performed step by step."  Two maintenance
                         technicians who were very familiar with these maintenance procedures, therefore,
                         did not follow step-by-step, resulting in several minor supporting requirements
                         being missed (e.g., public address announcements when system taken out of
                         service, etc.).

       (d)               The process of transferring a facility to various modes for maintenance, repair,
and
                         operations has been formalized; however, many flaws in the process were
observed. 
                         For example, no system post-maintenance testing was specified or performed,
                         although the four different critical safety systems were manipulated and the pre-
                         operational checklists may be performed again following maintenance at the
discretion
                         of the facility manager.

       (e)               Material deficiencies with the fire suppression system (valve stem packing leaks)
were
                         observed but not documented by the fire department technicians operating the
system. 
                         No deficiency tag existed as required by local procedures. Upon questioning, the
                         technicians stated that such items are normally reported verbally to their
supervisor.

     2.   The Manufacturing Division has recently (February 1995) effected an organizational
          restructuring designed to improve the weapons assembly and disassembly operations by
          clearly delineating the roles of the division operations, facility, and program managers.
          Although briefings on this restructuring have been given to individuals in the division, the
          details of the restructuring have not been formally promulgated.  Meanwhile, the
          certification process for weapons evolutions and actual weapons operations continue. 
          The lack of formal promulgation of this restructuring is not in keeping with the
          requirements placed on managers, supervisors, and operators by DOE Order 5480.19.
       
     3.   The M&H Drill Program was reviewed.  Only three drill sets have been run thus far in
          1995; all three were very simplistic.  The Drill Schedule for the remainder of 1995
          averages only four drill sets per quarter over all of the Manufacturing Division.
   
 5.  Follow-up Activities:  The Board's staff will continue to follow conduct of operations and
     training and qualification program implementation as part of normal staff reviews of Pantex
     activities.
