mbined radio and X-ray observations suggest that a 
vast bubble of high energy particles is pushing the hot gas aside, 
creating the Hydra-like loops of hot gas.  Similar processes are 
likely to be at work in other galaxy clusters, and in newly 
forming galaxies that are collapsing from a cloud of gas.  By 
using images with Chandra and other telescopes, astronomers may 
eventually conquer a "monstrous" problem of cosmic significance.

     The Chandra image was taken with the Advanced CCD Imaging 
Spectrometer (ACIS) on October 30, 1999, in an observation that 
lasted about six hours.

      NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, manages 
the Chandra program.  TRW, Inc., Redondo Beach, CA, is the prime 
contractor for the spacecraft.  The Smithsonian's Chandra X-ray 
Center controls science and flight operations from Cambridge, MA.
