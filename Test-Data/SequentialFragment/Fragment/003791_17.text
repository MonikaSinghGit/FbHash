                         observed but not documented by the fire department technicians operating the
system. 
                         No deficiency tag existed as required by local procedures. Upon questioning, the
                         technicians stated that such items are normally reported verbally to their
supervisor.

     2.   The Manufacturing Division has recently (February 1995) effected an organizational
          restructuring designed to improve the weapons assembly and disassembly operations by
          clearly delineating the roles of the division operations, facility, and program managers.
          Although briefings on this restructuring have been given to individuals in the division, the
          details of the restructuring have not been formally promulgated.  Meanwhile, the
          certification process for weapons evolutions and actual weapons operations continue. 
          The lack of formal promulgation of this restructuring is not in keeping with the
          requirements placed on managers, supervisors, and operators by DOE Order 5480.19.
       
     3.   The M&H Drill Program was reviewed.  Only three drill sets have been run thus far in
          1995; all three were very simplistic.  The Drill Schedule for the remainder of 1995
          averages only four drill sets per quarter over all of the Manufacturing Division.
   
 5.  Follow-up Activities:  The Board's staff will continue to follow conduct of operations and
     training and qualification program implementation as part of normal staff reviews of Pantex
     activities.
