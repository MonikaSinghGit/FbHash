2d 710, 714 (5th Cir.), cert.denied, 423 U.S. 914 (1975) (defendant properly excluded frominterview with juror who had been offered a bribe, and from subsequentdiscussion with counsel);  United States v. Ruiz-Estrella, 481 F.2d723 (2d Cir. 1973) (defendant properly excluded from portion ofsuppression hearing dealing with secret profile).   /18/ The pertinent difference between Rule 43 and theconstitutional right to be present at conferences between judge andjuror is that the defendant may invoke the latter only when hispresence would be useful to his defense, while the former creates astrong presumption in favor of the defendant's presence.  Neither Rule43 nor the Constitution guarantees the defendant's right to be presentwhere other legitimate interests would be infringed.  The court ofappeals failed to recognize any limits on the Rule 43 rightwhatsoever, and thus erroneously reversed these convictions and set adamaging precedent for future cases.   /19/ As in Estelle, 425 U.S. at 512 n.9, it is irrelevant whetherthe decision not to attend the conference was "a defense tactic orsimply indifference.  In either case, respondent's silence precludesany suggestion of compulsion."   /20/ The court of appeals apparently thought that this standard isless "stringent" than the Johnson v. Zerbst standard it applied to theconstitutional right to be present at trial.  App., infra, 11a.However, as this Court observed in Estelle, 425 U.S. at 512, torequire the trial court to make inquiries regarding the voluntarinessof an act would be equivalent to imposing the Johnson v. Zerbststandard.  In any event, this Court has applied the same analysis towaiver of the right to be present at trial under both Rule 43 and theConstitution, without distinction.  Failure by a criminal defendant,represented by competent counsel, to invoke his right to be present ata conference between judge and juror constitutes a valid waiver.   /21/ The court stated that respondents' failure to object wasrelevant to the question of prejudice, but not to the question ofvoluntary absence, or waiver.  App., infra, 10a-11a.   /22/ The advisory committee notes to Rule 43 confirm this analysis. The notes state that "voluntary absence may constitute a waiver evenif the defendant has not been informed by the court of his (right) toremain during the trial."   /23/ It seems clear that the contemporaneous objection requirementapplies to a supposed infringement of the right to be present attrial.  Had the error been called to the attention of the trial judgebefore the end of trial, he could have cured any possible prejudice bysubstituting the alternate jurors for the two jurors who observedrespondent Gagnon sketching.  The obligation to afford the trial courtan opportunity to remedy an error at trial is the principal basis forthe contemporaneous objection requirement.  Estelle v. Williams, 425U.S. at 508 n.3.   But even assuming defendants were under no obligation to object inorder to preserve this issue for appeal, no reversible error resultedfrom the juror interview.  A denial of the right to be present attrial does not warrant reversal of a conviction unless it resulted inprejudice to the defense.  Rushen v. Spain, supra.  We believe thatthe court of appeals was cearly incorrect in its conclusion (App.,infra, 13a-14a) that respondents' absence from the juror interview wasnot harmless error.  Indeed, we believe their absence enhanced theirability to secure a fair trial before an impartial jury.  See pages13-14, supra.  In this connection, we would note that the court'sapplication (App., infra, 13a) of the constitutional harmless errorstandard to what we have shown above was at most a violation of Rule43 (see pages 16-17, supra) was in error.   /24/ Copies of our brief in Young have been provided to counsel forrespondents.   /25/ We can agree that, "in certain circumstances" (App., infra,11a n.2), the denial of the right to be present might well be sofundamental an error that it should be noticed by an appellate courteven in the absence of a timely objection.  See, e.g., Rogers v.United States, 422 U.S. 35, 41 (1975).  However, the court of appealsdid not, as its statement of the law would suggest, inquire whether infact there were any circumstances here (i.e., substantial prejudice tothe defense) that would warrant a finding of plain error.  Wetherefore interpret the court as holding that no finding ofsubstantial prejudice is required.   /26/ For an error to be "plain," it must be both obvious andsubstantially prejudicial.  Although the focus of the discussion tofollow is on the court of appeals' failure to make a finding ofsubstantial prejudice, we would also point out that the error (if itwas error) was far from obvious.  Indeed, our position is that it wasnot error at all.  See pages 12-22, supra.  Even if this Courtdisagrees, we would submit that the question of the correctness of thetrial court's actions is, at worst, a close one.   /27/ Both this case and Rushen involve conferences between thetrial judge and a juror without the defendant being present.  InRushen, however, no defense counsel was present;  indeed, thedefendants did not even find out about the conference until aftertrial (slip op. 2).  Here, by contrast, the conference was announcedin open court and attended by defense counsel.  Further, in Rushen, notranscript was made of the conference;  the defendants or a reviewingcourt therefore had no reliable means of knowing what transpired.Here, a transcript was prepared and available to all parties.  If theerror in Rushen could be held to be harmless, the error here, if any,could hardly be plain error.   Rushen was decided by this Court four days after the court ofappeals rendered the judgment below, but it was forcefully called tothe court's attention by the government's unsuccessful petition forrehearing.   /28/ In Rogers, the trial court, without notifying the defendant ordefense counsel, made a misleading written response to a query fromthe jury.  The possibility that the error affected the jury's verdictwas substantial.   /29/ Although the analysis of prejudice in the decisions discussedin text is sometimes under the rubric of "harmless error" rather than"plain error," that fact does not detract from the conflict in thecircuits.  If an error is so nonprejudicial that it is harmless, itobviously falls short of the stringent "miscarriage of justice"standard for finding plain error.  See United States v. Silverstein,732 F.2d at 1349.   /30/ On the issue of prejudice, the decision below also conflictswith United States v. Silverstein, 732 F.2d at 1348-1349 (defendant'sabsence from courtroom while the trial court formulated a response toa query from the jury not reversible error because defense counsel waspresent, no objection was made, and the outcome of the trial was notlikely affected).  Silverstein differs from the instant case in thatthe proceeding from which the defendants were absent was a conferencebetween trial court and counsel on an issue of law.  Such conferencesare expressly permitted to be held in the absence of the defendantunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(3), and the convictions in Silversteincould have been affirmed on that ground.   /31/ In Rushen, the only issue was whether an assumed violation ofthe right to be present at trial was subject to a "harmless error"analysis.  Here, the question is whether criminal defendants will bepermitted to remain silent at trial, and then obtain reversal ofconvictions on the basis of insubstantial claims of prejudice.  Thedisruptive effect of the decision below could be significant.   APPENDIX
