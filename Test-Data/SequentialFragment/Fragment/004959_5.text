t business practices relating to security and law
enforcement issues (including cyberstalking), develop and distribute training
materials for law enforcement about the investigation and prosecution of
Internet crime, and promote more effective communication and cooperation
between industry and law enforcement in combating online criminal activity.

o The industry should establish and enforce clear policies that prohibit
cyberstalking and related behaviors, including terminating the accounts of
persons who violate such policies. While it appears that most of the larger ISPs
have such policies, some smaller ISPs do not. Representatives from the Internet
industry should consider establishing an industrywide code of conduct that
encourages all ISPs to adopt such procedures.

o The industry should establish clear, accessible, and understandable
procedures for individuals--customers and noncustomers--to register
complaints about use of a company's service to engage in cyberstalking.



o The industry should develop and widely disseminate educational materials to
customers and others on how to protect themselves online.

Advocate and Victim Services Provider Recommendations

o Victim services providers and advocates should provide direct services and
referrals to resources designed to assist victims of cyberstalking and work to
ensure that cyberstalking services are expanded to meet the needs of victims
and enhance their safety.

o Victim services providers and advocates should train domestic violence and
other advocates on Internet technology, the tactics used by cyberstalkers, and
how to respond to the specific needs of cyberstalking victims.

o Victim services providers and advocates should name the behavior as
cyberstalking and validate that a crime is occurring when working with
individual victims.

o Victim services providers and advocates should serve as catalysts in
community efforts to form partnerships among law enforcement, prosecution,
the judiciary, the medical community, and other community allies to address the
specific safety needs of cyberstalking victims and to hold offenders accountable
for their actions.

o Victim services providers and advocates should raise public awareness about
the devastating impact on cyberstalking victims of the tactics used by
cyberstalkers and the steps that can be taken to prevent and combat this crime.

o Victim services providers and advocates should inform public policy
decisionmaking.

Protecting Yourself Against Cyberstalking and What To Do If You Are a
Victim

Prevention Tips

o Do not share personal information in public spaces anywhere online, nor give
it to strangers, including in e-mail or chat rooms. Do not use your real name or
nickname as your screen name or user ID. Pick a name that is gender and age
neutral, and do not post personal information as part of any user profiles.

o Be extremely cautious about meeting online acquaintances in person. If you
choose to meet, do so in a public place and take along a friend.

o Make sure that your ISP and Internet Relay Chat network have an
acceptable-use policy that prohibits cyberstalking. If your network fails to
respond to your complaints, consider switching to a provider that is more
responsive to user complaints.

o If a situation online becomes hostile, log off or surf elsewhere. If a situation
places you in fear, contact a local law enforcement agency.

What To Do If You Are Being Cyberstalked

o If you are receiving unwanted contact, make clear to that person that you
would like him or her not to contact you again.

o Save all communications for evidence. Do not edit or alter them in any way.
Also, keep a record of your contacts with Internet system administrators and
law enforcement officials.

o You may want to consider blocking or filtering messages from the harasser.
Many e-mail programs such as Eudora and Microsoft Outlook have a filter
feature, and software can be easily obtained that will automatically delete
e-mails from a particular e-mail address or that contain offensive words. Chat
room contact can be blocked as well. Although formats differ, a common chat
room command to block someone would be to type /ignore<person's screen
name> (without the brackets). However, in some circumstances (such as
threats of violence), it may be more appropriate to save the information and
contact law enforcement authorities.

o If harassment continues after you have asked the person to stop, contact the
harasser's ISP. Most ISPs have clear policies prohibiting the use of their
services to abuse another person. Often, an ISP can try to stop the conduct by
direct contact with the stalker or by closing his or her account. If you receive
abusive e-mails, identify the domain (after the "@" sign) and contact that ISP.
Most ISPs have an e-mail address such as abuse@<domain name> or
postmaster@<domain name> that can be used for complaints. If the ISP has a
Web site, visit it for information on how to file a complaint. 

o Contact your local police department and inform its officers of the situation in
as much detail as possible. In appropriate cases, they may refer the matter to
State or Federal authorities. If you are afraid to take action, there are resources
available to help you. Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline,
1-800-799-SAFE (phone) or 1-800-787-3224 (TDD), or a local women's
shelter for advice and support.

Chapter 2 
Law Enforcement and Prosecution Response to Stalking--Results of a National
Survey

This chapter examines the criminal justice system's response to stalking across
the country by providing an overview of State laws and case law on stalking
and reporting the results of a national survey of law enforcement and
prosecution practices in this area.[9]

Survey of State Laws

Every State, and the District of Columbia, has enacted some type of stalking
law. In 12 States, conviction for a first offense of stalking is automatically a
felony, and in 23 States, a first offense of stalking may be a felony. In the
remaining 15 States, a first offense is a misdemeanor, but a repeat stalking
conviction is a felony.

Many States have statutes that address stalking-related conduct. Offenses
include harassment (25 States), threats and intimidation (35 States and the
District of Columbia), telephone threats or harassment (43 States), and letter
threats (20 States). Ten States provide enhanced felony penalties for
harassment or stalking of a minor.

Twenty-seven States provide for civil protection orders to be issued against
stalking, in addition to orders of protection against domestic violence. Violation
of a stalking protection order is a crime in 25 of these States and may be
criminal contempt of court in the other 2 States. In only five States can a
violation of the stalking order be treated as a felony; in many others, repeat
stalking in violation of an order is aggravated stalking and a felony. In addition,
in eight States, repeat violations of a stalking order can be a felony. In six
States, legislation provides for the entry of stalking protection orders into a
special statewide registry for these orders. Thirty-five States also have registries
for domestic violence protection orders, and these orders often include
antistalking provisions.

In 10 States where stalking can be a misdemeanor offense, State law authorizes
warrantless arrest for stalking, similar to that authorized for misdemeanor
domestic violence. In the 12 States where stalking is always a felony,
warrantless arrest is authorized where probable cause exists. In Mississippi,
warrantless arrest for misdemeanor stalking is authorized where the stalking is
against a spouse or former spouse.

Training of law enforcement officers on stalking is required only in Minnesota
and Nevada. However, 30 States require law enforcement training on domestic
violence, a requirement that may be administratively interpreted to include
stalking.

Case Law Review

As of August 2000, nearly 500 stalking and related cases prosecuted at the
Federal, State, and local levels had been identified (see appendix A). Cases
involving stalking were most common (157 cases), followed by harassment
(142 cases) and threats (122 cases). Only a few State stalking laws have been
struck down on the basis of overly vague terms such as "annoy" or lacking an
intent requirement. 

Double-jeopardy claims were another common challenge, typically where there
had been a previous finding of contempt of court for violation of a court order,
such as a protection order or an injunction. Rulings varied based on whether the
criminal offense and the contempt offense shared common facts. Where the
court found that the two offenses shared common facts, it ruled that a criminal
trial for both offenses violated the defendant's constitutional right not to be tried
twice for the same crime.

Harassment laws that are not limited to prohibitions on "fighting words," which
are not entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment as are other
kinds of speech, were the most vulnerable to constitutional challenge.[10]
However, courts held that telephone harassment laws were not required to
have such a limitation because of their invasion of privacy component. For
much the same reason, telephone harassment and threat laws commonly focus
on the intent of the caller to harass or threaten rather than the victim's response
to these messages. In fact, a few States do not require actual fear to result from
the harassment.

Despite the growing popularity of electronic communication, there are very few
reported cases involving this medium. Some of the cases indicate that courts
may be reluctant to apply old laws to this new means of delivering threats or
harassing communications without explicit statutory language addressing the use
of electronic communication to stalk, harass, or threaten.

Practitioner Surveys

Two hundred and four law enforcement agencies and 222 prosecution offices in
jurisdictions with populations of more than 250,000 were surveyed by mail in
November 1997. The survey asked what special efforts these agencies had
undertaken against stalking, including special units, training, and written policies
and procedures.[11] The survey found that all but seven of the police agencies
surveyed assign stalking cases either to their detective unit or to a specialized
unit, most commonly the domestic violence unit, or to a combination of
detectives and domestic violence investigators. A few agencies assign stalking
cases to their sex crimes unit. Only one has a specialized stalking unit.

Most of the prosecution offices surveyed similarly assign stalking cases to their
domestic violence unit. A significant minority (15 percent) split stalking case
duties between their domestic violence unit and another unit, usually the general
trial unit. Another important pattern is for stalking to be handled by a special
unit that is responsible for prosecution of domestic violence, sex crimes, and
other kinds of specialized cases such as child or elder abuse. Seven offices
have either a specialized stalking unit or an assistant or deputy prosecutor who
specializes in stalking cases.

Stalking training for police recruits is typically part of their domestic violence
training. About 13 percent of the agencies have specialized training on stalking
independent of domestic violence, although several offer both types of training.
Less than 15 percent of the police agencies do not offer stalking training to
recruits. Significantly, more than one-third do not provide inservice stalking
training to their officers. Slightly more than half reported that inservice training
on stalking is provided to all detectives or to special unit detectives.

Most of the prosecution offices surveyed (82 percent) provide some training on
stalking. About 25 percent of the offices provide inservice stalking training to all
their attorneys, and 17 percent provide stalking training to new attorneys. Most
of the latter agencies provide both inservice and new attorney training. More
than one-third of the offices limit their inservice training to special unit
prosecutors. Ten percent of the prosecution offices said that the only stalking
training their attorneys get is from outside training sources.

Fifty-seven percent of the police agencies surveyed have written policies and
procedures for handling stalking cases, most often as part of their domestic
violence protocols. Only 11 agencies have separate stalking protocols. A
slightly smaller proportion (50 percent) of prosecution offices said they had
written policies for prosecuting stalking cases. Only six offices have separate
stalking protocols, including one office with both policies and protocols.

The written comments provided by the respondents indicate that prosecutors in
several States have problems with the statutory "credible threat" requirement.
However, some prosecutors in these States did not report such problems. The
reasons for this difference may be related to methods of coordination between
law enforcement and prosecution in stalking cases. The need for training was
expressed by many respondents.

Field Studies

Site visits have been completed in six locations: the Los Angeles Police
Department's threat management unit, the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's stalking and threat assessment prosecution unit, the San Diego
County District Attorney's stalking prosecution unit, the San Jose Police
Department's stalking unit, the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office,
and the Colorado Springs Police Department. 

Preliminary findings from these sites show some significant similarities:

o Specialized stalking units provide expertise in identifying, investigating, and
prosecuting stalking crimes.

o Staffing of specialized units is essentially experimental, so central units share
jurisdiction over stalking crimes with other agency units, taking only the most
serious cases.

o Failure to identify stalking behavior is a continuing problem. All of the
specialized units devote considerable resources to training other criminal justice
personnel and educating the community.

o Because both stalking legislation and specialized stalking units are relatively
new, case management requires the development of new techniques for
investigation and for ensuring victim safety. Investigators and prosecutors of
stalking operate as problem solvers for tasks such as identifying who the stalker
is, how to prove stalking, and how to work with victims to collect evidence
while keeping them safe.

Training Programs

A number of jurisdictions provide training on stalking. A few jurisdictions have
had training for only their law enforcement officers, typically of a limited
duration (e.g., rollcall training). Many others have had more extensive training,
typically involving multidisciplinary audiences. Some prosecutors have provided
informal training to the judiciary on stalking issues through extensive filings of
motions and briefs that explain the nature of stalking and its impact on victims.

----------------------------

Chapter 3 
Victim Needs

In Stalking in America: Findings From the National Violence Against Women
Survey,[12] the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) reported that stalking is much
more prevalent than previously thought, with an estimated 1 million women and
370,000 men stalked annually. The report found that stalking is most often
perpetrated against current or former intimate partners, with young women
between ages 18 and 29 as the primary targets. More recently, in the 2000
Report to Congress evaluating the STOP Violence Against Women Formula
Grants, the Urban Institute noted that stalking is the least understood of the
three crimes addressed by VAWA. Only eight States address stalking in their
STOP implementation plans.[13]

Based on these reports and the growing body of research on stalking and
domestic violence, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime
(OVC) convened a national focus group to gather information about the needs
of stalking victims. The focus group brought together stalking victims, victim
advocates, and victim assistance providers, as well as prosecutors and law
enforcement officers who have worked with stalking victims. Their discussion
explored the effects of stalking on victims' lives and how communities can better
address the needs of stalking victims. Participants who had been stalked
described the psychological and physical impact of the terrorizing tactics used
by their stalkers. Others shared information from their experiences in assisting
victims who had been stalked. Participants identified gaps in service provision
and barriers to accessing services and made recommendations for improving
aid to stalking victims and preventing future crimes. This chapter summarizes the
focus group discussion.

Victim Experiences of Stalking

The victims participating in the discussion described frightening accounts of
being stalked for as long as years at a time. One participant was stalked by a
man she had dated, two participants by former spouses, one by a former
employee, one by a stranger who was mentally ill, one by a neighbor, and one
by a cyberstalker of unknown identity. Their experiences varied based on
multiple factors: 

o Their relationship with the stalker.

o The mental health status of the stalker.

o The motivations of the stalker, if known. 

o The tactics used by the stalker.

o The frequency, intensity, and intrusiveness of the stalking acts.

o Whether the stalker also was targeting the victim's family and friends.

o The locations where the stalking acts occurred, such as workplace or college
campus. 

o The levels of support and services available in their communities.

o The accessibility of community support and services, which varied based on
factors such as disabilities, financial status, and gender.

o Whether the justice system was proactive on the victim's behalf.

o Whether the stalker's behavior stopped.

While the specific circumstances surrounding the stalking were unique, victims
recounted many similar issues and concerns. The most common result of the
stalking was the terror it evoked in victims.

Tactics Used to Control Victims

The motive for stalking is not sexual; rather, it is anger or hostility toward the
victim and a desire to control the victim. Participants in the focus group asserted
that their stalkers had systematically tried to subjugate them. Stalkers employ
various acts of terrorism over a period of weeks, months, years, or even
decades, which has the cumulative effect of eroding victims' self-confidence and
sense of control over their lives. Some acts convey subtle messages meant to
instill fear, while others brutally remind victims of their stalkers' dominance over
them. Discussion participants described a range of stalking tactics that included:

o Leaving or sending unwanted messages, such as sending letters written in
blood or cut-up pictures of victims. 

o Breaking into and vandalizing property, such as homes and cars.

o Following, harassing, and defaming victims.

----------------------------

One victim was stalked for 3 years, during which the stalker broke into her
house, beat her, and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. 

In addition to enduring beatings, vandalism to her house and car, and threats
of bodily injury, another victim received 6 to 10 unwanted letters a day from
her stalker, typically 8 pages long, written on both sides.

In another case, a stalker widely disseminated false information on the
Internet--claiming, among other things, that the victim was available for sex and
listing her address and phone number.

----------------------------

o Tracking down victims' contact information in cases in which victims try to
hide (e.g., through neighbors, employers, and even the police). 

o Impersonating people trusted by victims to obtain access to them.

o Threatening physical harm or death to victims, family members, and friends,
such as threatening to place a bomb in a victim's car or to kill a victim's lawyer.

o Killing victims' pets. 

o Kidnapping victims.

o Physically attacking and torturing victims. 

o Sexually assaulting victims.

o Using weapons to hurt or kill victims.

The control tactics described by focus group participants mirror those tactics
reported in the National Violence Against Women (NVAW) survey. The
survey found that the most common activities engaged in by stalkers include
following or spying on victims, standing outside victims' homes or places of
work or recreation (82 percent), making unsolicited phone calls (61 percent),
sending or leaving unwanted letters or other items (33 percent), vandalizing
property (29 percent), and killing or threatening to kill family pets (9
percent).[14]

Dealing With Fear 

In the face of the danger posed by their stalkers, victims typically confront the
daily task of keeping themselves and their family members safe. They may tell
family, friends, employers, coworkers, daycare providers, and criminal justice
system professionals about what is happening in attempts to seek assistance.
Like victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, stalking victims sometimes
spend an inordinate amount of time attempting to convince others to believe that
they are being stalked and are in real danger. Participants reported that victims
deal with varying reactions from others, including:

o Disbelief.

o Blaming the victim for causing the stalking, particularly in cases where victims
know their stalkers.

o Believing the victim but refusing to help or support the victim.

o Believing the victim, taking the victim's concerns seriously, and offering
support and assistance. 

----------------------------

A number of victims described stalking as a nightmare that invaded all aspects
of their lives. They spent a great deal of energy, time, and money just trying to
stay alive. 

----------------------------

The victims participating in the discussion all reported stalking or related abuses
to local police at some point. Some victims encountered disbelief or apathy
from officers. Others indicated that officers were sympathetic to their plight but
lacked the legal authority to intervene to stop the stalking. In some instances,
stalkers were eventually charged with crimes, convicted, and incarcerated. In
other cases, the stalkers' acts were not considered illegal and the victims fled
and relocated to other states.

According to the NVAW survey, 55 percent of the surveyed female victims
reported their stalking to the police.[15] When other victims were asked why
they chose not to report their stalking to the police, they stated that the stalking
was not a police matter, they thought the police would not be able to do
anything, or they feared reprisals from their stalkers. Victims often go to
extraordinary lengths to keep themselves safe, including:

o Changing all personal contact information such as phone and fax numbers,
postal and e-mail addresses, and driver's license and social security numbers. 

o Trying to restrict public access to their personal records such as getting their
names off all mailing lists and making sure companies and public agencies do
not give out their personal information.

o Getting devices that allow them to screen who has contact with them, such as
voice mail and caller I.D. boxes for telephones. 

o Changing their lifestyles and restricting their communication with others by, for
example, altering routines, discontinuing activities, switching jobs, finding new
schools for children, temporarily or permanently relocating, and ceasing
communication with family and friends.

----------------------------

One victim told of police officers being called to her home on numerous
occasions, listening to her accounts of being stalked, and taking written notes.
She found out only later that not one report had ever been officially filed.

Another victim said that she went to the police only after her stalker broke her
nose in broad daylight. They told her it would be too hard to prosecute her
case. She endured numerous attacks by the stalker after her initial interaction
with law enforcement, including one that left her hearing disabled.

One victim indicated that she received assistance from an FBI agent who got
involved in her case when the stalker started sending threatening letters to her
through the U.S. Postal Service. Prior to this intervention, however, she
endured years of increasingly violent stalking acts.

----------------------------

One victim spent approximately 2 years hiding from her stalker in basements of
people she knew, only going home every couple of days to feed her pets. Her
stalker eventually attempted to shoot her.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Victim Safety

The Address Confidentiality Program, coordinated by Washington's Secretary
of State Office, helps stalking, sexual assault, and domestic violence victims
maintain address confidentiality by offering them a substitute mailing address.
For more information, call 360-586-4386 or 360-586-4388 (TTY) (Olympia,
WA).

----------------------------

Emotional and Physiological Reactions

In addition to living in fear and paying constant attention to maintaining their
physical safety, victims may experience harmful responses from individuals and
institutions, such as the criminal justice system or their workplace. Many spoke
of having reactions common to the experiences of other survivors of trauma,
including:

o Powerlessness/loss of control. 

o Feelings of desperation and isolation. 

o Self-blame or shame.

o Hypervigilance and overreactivity. 

o Sleep disturbances such as nightmares and difficulty falling asleep or staying
awake. 

o Avoidance of intimacy. 

o Weight loss or gain.

o Substance abuse.

o Intense fear of specific and general things such as being alone or in crowds. 

o Anxiety and depression.


o Spiritual crises.

These descriptions by the focus group victims also support the findings of the
NVAW survey concerning the psychological and social consequences of
stalking. About one-third of the women surveyed said they sought
psychological counseling as a result of their stalking victimization.[16] The
report also showed that stalking victims were significantly more likely than
members of the general population to be very concerned about their personal
safety and about being stalked, to carry something to defend themselves, and to
think personal safety has gotten worse in recent years.[17] Numerous
advocates and service providers at the focus group meeting indicated that the
stalking victims they encounter often experience posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).

Lifetime Ordeal

The ongoing nature of the crime often makes it particularly difficult for victims to
recover from the effects of the stalking. While the victims participating in the
discussion were not currently being stalked, they all indicated that they live in
some degree of fear that the stalking will start anew. They expressed two
reasons for this fear:

o Even when the criminal justice system imprisons or institutionalizes stalkers, it
typically does not detain them forever.

o If victims successfully fled from their stalkers by relocating or changing their
identity, they are not fully confident that the stalkers will not eventually discover
their new location or identity.

----------------------------

One victim recounted that after serving a reduced jail sentence, the offender
resumed his stalking activities at a more frequent and violent level.

----------------------------

Secondary Victims

Participants stressed that stalking also affects secondary victims, such as
children and other family members, friends, co-workers, and other
acquaintances. These individuals can suffer because:

o They may become an object of the stalker's attacks as a way of controlling
the primary victim. 

o They may witness stalking acts against the primary victim. 

o They may be traumatized as they try to support the primary victim. 

o They may be affected indirectly as a result of the stalking (e.g., a friend misses
work in order to assist the victim, or children miss school because they are
fleeing the stalker). 

Participants were particularly concerned about the plight of children who
witness stalking or who are stalked themselves. A number of service providers
at the meeting expressed alarm that in situations where stalkers and victims have
children in common, courts sometimes require victims and their children to stay
in the same State as their stalkers.

Costs of Stalking to Victims 

Although there are no comprehensive nationwide data on the overall cost of
stalking, it was obvious from participant feedback that victims experience
enormous losses. The focus group cited several losses to victims that are
directly attributable to stalking: property damage and destruction, physical and
emotional injuries requiring short- and long-term medical and mental health
treatment, lost wages, expenditures related to hiding from the stalkers and
maintaining safety, and pain, suffering, and an overall reduced quality of life.

It can quickly become very costly for stalking victims to maintain safety and
health given the long-term nature of the crime and the multitude of tactics that
stalkers employ. However, the extensive financial assistance and/or resources
these victims require are simply not available in most communities. 

While many State crime compensation programs will cover some expenses
related to stalking (e.g., counseling), some States do not cover expenses unless
a violent incident has occurred. Most State programs do not cover the range of
victim expenses related to relocation, such as moving costs and lost wages.

----------------------------

As a consequence of stalking, one victim was fired from her job and forced to
declare bankruptcy.

----------------------------


The NVAW survey also addressed the cost of stalking. It reported that 26
percent of the stalking victims said their victimization caused them to lose time
from work. The survey authors attributed this lost time to the same reasons
identified by the focus group: to attend court hearings, meet with a psychologist
or other mental health professional, avoid contact with the assailant, and consult
with an attorney. Seven percent of the victims responding to the NVAW survey
said they never returned to work. For those victims who returned to work, the
average time missed due to their stalking victimization was 11 days.[18]

Professionals Who Can Help

Victims of stalking require a wide range of services from victim assistance
providers, victim advocates, justice system personnel, and other community
professionals. These service providers must:

o Validate that the stalking experienced by the victim is indeed occurring.

o Understand the complexity of the crime and the danger posed by stalkers.

o Have the capacity to provide effective intervention strategies that protect and
support victims and restrict stalkers. 

Service providers, victim advocates, and criminal justice personnel need to
provide immediate assistance to victims dealing with stalking. They must be
sensitive to the victim's need for confidentiality and ensure that information
pertaining to the victim is not released to a third party without the victim's
permission. After providing information on safety planning and resources, those
working with stalking victims need to respect and support the decisions victims
make concerning their own safety, even when they do not agree with victims'
decisions.[19]

Communities generally lack justice system personnel, victim assistance
providers, and advocates with sufficient knowledge or capacity to provide
specialized assistance for stalking victims, particularly for those who are being
stalked by strangers or acquaintances or through the Internet. The focus group
reported that other community professionals, such as doctors, mental health
providers, welfare and child protection workers, daycare providers, school
staff, employers, and church leaders, also lack knowledge about how to identify
and respond to stalking.

Response Tailored to Individual Circumstances

Victim experiences vary due to multiple factors, which must be taken into
account when developing effective responses to promote victim safety and
restrict the actions of stalkers. Specifically, victims emphasized that it is
important not to evaluate the stalker's behavior based on the victim's
relationship with the stalker. Instead, those working with stalking victims should
incorporate prior knowledge of each particular stalker with studied behavior
patterns of stalkers in general to develop a proper response. Because stalking
behavior is unpredictable, mechanisms must be in place to protect victims if and
when stalking escalates.

----------------------------

Promising Practice: Individualized Response

In 1996, the Victim Services Stalking Unit of the Queens, New York, Criminal
Court Program received funding from the New York Crime Victims Board to
provide services to stalking victims, regardless of whether the victim was
physically injured in the course of the stalking crimes. The unit offers stalking
victims crisis intervention and emotional support, assistance with assessing risk
and safety planning, defense kits, instruction on keeping logs of evidence for
court, and legal advocacy and case management throughout the criminal justice
system. It also offers victims fact sheets, brochures, and tip cards, written in
both English and Spanish. For more information, call 718-286-6084 (Kew
Gardens, NY).

----------------------------

Many communities have justice system and victim assistance resources set up
to help domestic violence victims assess their risk of danger and plan for safety.
These resources may or may not be sufficient to help victims who are stalked
by partners or former partners. 

Underserved Populations of Victims

Stalking victims may face further obstacles to getting help because their
communities are not prepared to provide the individualized attention and
services they need, due to factors such as: 

o Physical, cognitive, or emotional disabilities.

o Language capacity. 

o Cultural and ethnic background.


o Socioeconomic status.

o Place of residence, such as a rural area or college campus.

o Gender.

o Sexual orientation.

o Immigration status.

o Religion.

o Race.

Agencies need specific training and technology to assist these victims
successfully. For example, victims with hearing disabilities need to be able to
communicate with others to get help. Assisting agencies should have TTY/TDD
machines and the capacity to use them, know how to use phone relay systems,
and have quick access to sign-language interpreters. Victims with a wide range
of experiences, resources, or capabilities need individuals with appropriate
sensitivities and cultural backgrounds to advocate for them, particularly in
interactions with agencies not equipped to deal with victims from diverse
communities.

Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

Focus group participants recounted several types of criminal justice
interventions that may be effective in maintaining victim safety and holding
offenders accountable. They include:

o Swift and timely law enforcement response.

o Dispatchers who address victim safety first and officers who make every
attempt to arrest stalkers.

o Investigation of each case thoroughly and aggressively with the goal of
charging stalkers with the fullest range of crimes possible.  

o Assistance for victims in assessing stalkers' potential lethality and developing
safety plans.

o Instruction for victims on how to document stalking activities and use
equipment to collect evidence such as an answering machine, tape recorder,
camera, or video camera.

o Helping victims obtain restraining orders or referring victims to advocates
who can assist them in obtaining restraining orders and a quick response to any
violations of these orders. 

o Aggressive prosecution and court responses that keep stalkers away from
victims after charges are filed, such as high bonds that may help keep stalkers
incarcerated before or during trials, or requests that no contact be a condition
of pretrial release.

o Providing victims with information about stalking crimes, legal remedies, and
referrals to community resources.

o Helping victims keep personal information confidential throughout criminal
justice proceedings (e.g., a stalker's attorney should not be able to obtain
information that the stalker can use to threaten or harass the victim). 

o Proactive prosecution and court responses that involve effective strategies to
deter stalkers from further acts of stalking and to protect victims, such as the
electronic monitoring of stalkers as part of sentencing. 

o Notifying victims of stalkers' pending release from correctional or mental
facilities and the conditions of their probation, along with assistance in
post-release safety planning and protection.

Promising Practice: Interventions by the Criminal Justice System

The Dover, New Hampshire, Police Department recently received an Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant to establish an
antistalking unit and develop antistalking countermeasures. The
countermeasures will comprise the following: vertical investigation and
prosecution, streamlined investigation methods and use of technology to
enhance investigations, use of global positioning satellite technology to monitor
offenders, and development of victim safety strategies, including assistance with
relocation. To coordinate victim relocation, the unit will partner with one or
more agencies to help victims maintain safety during transitions to their new
locations. For more information, call 603-743-6140.

----------------------------


Some justice agencies and professionals have developed creative strategies to
combat stalking and help victims maintain their safety. However, many criminal
justice agencies lack the capacity to provide the comprehensive protection
needed by stalking victims, often due to a lack of effective antistalking laws or
agency protocols addressing stalking. There is also a general lack of
understanding about the seriousness of the issue. Gaps in responses, such as
incorrectly charging stalking crimes and failing to enforce restraining orders
against stalkers, can result in increased danger for victims.

Other barriers to effective criminal justice system intervention include stalker
manipulation of the justice system and heavy evidence collection burdens on
victims. For example, some stalkers successfully shift attention away from
themselves by claiming that victims are stalking them or by accusing victims of
child abuse or neglect. At the same time, they continue to stalk the victims.
Moreover, realizing their cases will not go forward in the criminal justice system
without sufficient evidence, many victims spend a lot of time and energy keeping
detailed logs of stalking incidents and collecting supporting documentation. In
fact, in order to obtain evidence that the crime of stalking has been committed,
victims often have to endure more stalking acts.

----------------------------

One participant said that stalking is one of the few crimes where victims who
want their cases to go forward are cast as their own investigators and required
to do things that professionals usually do.

----------------------------

In order to pursue justice system remedies, stalking victims often meet with
investigators and prosecutors, gather evidence, fill out paperwork, petition the
court for protection orders, and testify against stalkers. They may have to miss
work and lose wages, provide for childcare, and find transportation. Not only
does justice system involvement often present financial and logistical problems
for victims, it also may increase the danger they face. Stalkers may try to make
contact with victims as they travel to and from government buildings. Many
victims view incarceration of their stalker as a temporary reprieve and are
consumed by fear of their offenders' pending release. For some victims,
however, even incarceration fails to end the violence; their stalkers continue to
terrorize them from prisons or mental institutions by sending them threatening
letters. 

Assistance and Advocacy for All Victims


Although it is imperative that the criminal justice system provide stalking victims
with support, information, and advocacy throughout criminal proceedings,
victims also need nonlegal resources and assistance to maintain their safety,
such as: 

o Confidential emergency shelter for victims who are in immediate danger. 

o Crime-specific crisis intervention and support for victims, family, and friends.

o Assistance in cutting off stalkers' access to information about victims.

o Access to safety-enhancing equipment such as cell phones and body alarms.

o Help in protecting children and other dependents from stalkers, including
representation in family courts to revoke stalkers' custody rights. 

As long as they feel any risk, victims need ongoing advocacy and assistance
with planning for their safety, as well as access to resources to implement their
plans. Some victims may feel so endangered that they are compelled to make
significant changes to hide from their stalkers, such as altering their identity or
relocating to another area, and will need comprehensive assistance similar to
that provided through witness protection programs.

Chapter 4
State Stalking Legislation Update--1998, 1999, and 2000 Sessions

States have enacted stalking legislation increasingly in each of the past 3 years.
In part, this reflects a growing understanding of the impact of stalking behavior.
New legislative topics are being addressed today that were not foreseeable
when legislators first addressed stalking crimes 10 years ago. The 3-year
review below summarizes stalking legislation from 1998 to 2000. It does not
include final information from about 12 legislatures that were still in session
when this review was completed in August 2000.

In 1998, the 44 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 150 new laws directed at violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 11 States passed laws amending their stalking and related criminal
laws, including 2 States that passed new stalking injunction laws (see table 1).
In 1999, the 49 State legislatures in session and the District of Columbia
enacted more than 300 laws relating to violence against women. Of these,
legislatures in 26 States passed laws related to stalking (see table 2). By August
2000, 20 of the 44 State legislatures in session had enacted 27 stalking related
laws (see table 3). Overall, fewer than 200 enactments in the 2000 legislative
year addressed violence against women issues.[20]

Many other laws directed at helping victims of domestic violence also may
apply when stalking behavior is related to domestic violence. For example, laws
requiring that a jurisdiction give full faith and credit to other jurisdictions'
protection orders may apply either to orders prohibiting stalking as an element
of domestic violence or to antistalking orders. Similarly, laws providing
confidentiality for victims of domestic violence may be used by stalking victims
when the stalker is a current or former intimate partner under the State
domestic violence law. Hence, this list of new laws is not all inclusive.

The new laws explicitly directed at stalking behavior primarily change either the
definition of or the penalty for stalking or authorize courts to issue antistalking
protection orders. Other new laws authorize arrest of misdemeanor stalkers
and prohibit firearm possession when an antistalking order has been issued. 

Stalking and Related Cases: 1990-2000

Challenges to State Antistalking Laws

Although it has been only 10 years since the first stalking law was enacted, the
passage of these laws in all 50 States has sparked considerable litigation over
their constitutionality and scope. In reviewing and interpreting stalking laws,
courts often have drawn on cases involving similar penal statutes--those
criminalizing harassment and those involving threats.[21] These laws not only
deal with related behavior, but they also use the kind of terms and phrases
(e.g., annoy, repeatedly) that may be the subject of legal attack by defendants.
Thus, analysis of stalking laws must examine all three types of criminal laws and
statutes covering threats and harassment by telephone.

This review identified 464 State and 17 Federal stalking and related cases in
which challenges to antistalking and related laws were addressed.[22] Among
these were a total of 157 stalking cases, including 2 Federal cases. The stalking
cases involved predominantly constitutional challenges (124 cases in 34 States
and the District of Columbia), typically based on vagueness, overbreadth, and
related First Amendment issues. The review also looked at the relationship
between the stalker and the victim in cases in which the relevant statutes were
challenged. This review found that 56 of the 129 stalking cases for which
relationship information was available involved nonintimate partners. This
category included 14 cases involving stranger stalking; the other nonpartner
cases covered relationships such as neighbors, ex-employees,
psychiatrist-patient, judge-litigant, and landlord-tenant. In 38 cases, the
perpetrator had a dating relationship with the victim, including several in which
the perpetrator cohabited with the victim. In many states, stalking against a
former dating partner can be classified as domestic violence for the purpose of
obtaining a court order of protection. In 35 cases, the perpetrators stalked
former wives from whom they were divorced or separated. Almost all of the
reported cases in which statutes were challenged involved male stalkers.

----------------------------

Among the stalking-related cases, 56 involved harassment and 100 involved
threats. These cases were selected for review because they involved either an
important legal question with implications for interpretation of the stalking law at
issue or a situation similar to stalking in which questions of sufficiency of the
evidence affected the court decision. In 41 of the harassment cases and 36 of
the threat cases, the defendant raised constitutional challenges. There were 43
harassment and 64 threat cases involving statutory construction issues. Many of
the 56 harassment cases raised constitutional and statutory construction issues.

Other types of cases covered by this review included 20 telephone threat
cases, 85 telephone harassment cases, 8 letter threat or harassment cases, and
6 electronic threat or harassment cases. In addition, 47 cases involved
protection orders, typically stalking charges related to violation of a protection
order. Three cases involved civil suits for damages based on civil stalking laws
or some other invasion of privacy. Among these cases were 87 constitutional
law decisions and 51 statutory construction decisions. There were also five
cases in which defendants raised jurisdictional or other constitutional challenges
to Federal laws.

The list of cases in appendix A does not necessarily include all relevant
reported cases, although a significant effort was made to identify such
cases.[23] The review excluded reported decisions that involved solely
evidentiary issues where no constitutional or statutory interpretation issues were
decided.[24] Threat and harassment cases that were totally unrepresentative of
stalking concerns also were excluded, while included, for example, were threats
and verbal abuse of police officers.[25] 

In general, court decisions reviewed here measured constitutional challenges
based on overbreadth by whether the law prohibits acts rather than speech and
by whether it contains an intent to cause a specified harm. Vagueness claims
generally were evaluated based on whether the harmful acts barred by the law
are of such specificity that an ordinary person would not fail to understand what
is prohibited. Therefore, statutes that criminalize acts that include an intent to
cause harm as an element of the offense were most likely to pass constitutional
muster. This finding is consistent with the precepts underlying the Model
Anti-Stalking Code,[26] which limits its scope to acts that create a fear of
serious injury and include an intent component. 

The review in appendix A identifies each case by the name of the litigants, type
of law involved, and case citation and gives a brief summary of the court's
decision. Court rulings apply only to the specific statutory language used in the
case before the court. Thus, while there may be general agreement among the
courts within a State on a particular legal issue, such an agreement may not be
relevant to the language used in a particular State statute. With this important
caveat, review of the cases suggests the following:

1. Most stalking statutes meet constitutional minimums. Inclusion of an intent
requirement resolves most vagueness challenges. However, the use of terms
such as "annoy" or "alarm" without limiting definitions makes a law vulnerable to
challenge on the basis that it is unconstitutionally vague. Statutes have been
upheld that establish a rebuttable presumption of intent where there is evidence
that the victim requested that the stalking conduct end. Most statutes require
that the prohibited acts include a threat component, that the defendant intend to
cause or know of the victim's fear of death or serious injury and that the victim's
fear be reasonable.

2.  A finding of contempt for a violation of a protection order does not
generally prevent a second prosecution for the substantive stalking offense on
double jeopardy grounds. Some courts may require, however, that the acts
constituting stalking be different from those underlying the charge of violating the
order. There is no agreement among the courts that evidence of a prior
restraining order may be admitted to show the defendant's intent or course of
action, but a prior order may be used to show victim fear. Courts differ on
whether a collateral attack may be permitted on the validity of a court order in
protection order violation proceedings.


3. Harassment laws are vulnerable to a constitutional challenge where the
prohibited speech is not limited to "fighting words." "Fighting words" refers to
language that is likely to lead to a physical confrontation. Such language is
entitled to less protection under the First Amendment.

4. It is permissible for threat laws that include a reasonable fear requirement to
equate reckless behavior by the perpetrator with intent to cause reasonable fear
for the victim. In some States, actual terror is not required, merely that fear
would be reasonable under the circumstances and that there is an intent to
terrorize. An intent to carry out the threat is not an element of the crime, and
physical acts alone may constitute a threat. The absence in most States of
statutory language defining stalking to include implied threats is made even more
significant by the lack of court rulings in many of these same States interpreting
threat laws to include implied or conditional threats.

5. Harassment and threat laws apply to communications delivered through
third parties where such delivery may be reasonably anticipated or intended.

6. Telephone harassment and threat laws usually focus on the intent of the
caller, not the response of the person called, because invasion of privacy is an
implicit second element of the crime. Intent must be complemented by proof of
harassment or threatening acts. A law barring intent alone without regard to the
actual contents of the communication will be overbroad. A few courts do,
however, require that victim fear result from a telephone threat, depending on
the specific language of the statute involved. Courts also are split on whether
harassing intent must be the sole purpose of the communication or may coexist
with legitimate motives for the communication.

7. Prosecution of electronic harassment by fax, Internet, citizen band radio, or
other means may require specific statutory language prohibiting the use of these
medias to harass.

8. Jurisdiction or venue lies in the locality or State where a non-face-to-face
threat or harassment communication is received. Jurisdiction also may lie in the
location from which the communication was sent.

9. Intrastate communication that involves interstate intermediaries to deliver
the message confers Federal jurisdiction over the crime where a Federal statute
applies to the conduct.

In the first 10 years since stalking has been criminalized, most courts have
recognized the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting citizens against
stalking. Accordingly, courts generally have affirmed the constitutionality of
antistalking legislation when weighed against First Amendment concerns.


However, a number of courts have struck down related laws that lack specific
fighting words requirements to narrow their scope. Courts also are beginning to
accommodate legal complications often resulting from the repetitive nature of
the stalking crime, in some cases allowing separate prosecutions for protection
order violations and substantive offenses. However, there is no broad
agreement across jurisdictions that these offenses may be tried separately
without raising double jeopardy concerns.

Unfortunately, at least two major gaps remain in States' legislative initiatives
against stalking and their interpretations by the courts. State legislatures and
courts frequently fail to recognize implied or conditional threats in their
construction of the stalking crime. Stalkers who follow, repeatedly contact, and
otherwise terrorize their victims in a persistent and even obsessive manner may
slip through the cracks of the criminal justice system if they refrain from spelling
out their threats. Such legislative loopholes need to be addressed.

In addition, current stalking legislation lacks explicit bars to harassment via
electronic media such as telephones, fax machines, e-mail, and the Internet. By
and large, courts are not interpreting older legislation to cover recently
developed communications technologies. Such narrow interpretation of
antistalking codes does not cover cyberstalking and other modes of high-tech
terrorization. Thus, many States may need to enact specific legislative bans on
the use of such media for stalking purposes. When use of these communications
technologies crosses State lines, however, courts have agreed that Federal
jurisdiction is conferred. To date, prosecution under Federal laws may have
been more successful than State prosecution in bringing high-tech stalkers to 
justice.

Chapter 5 
Federal Prosecutions

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) made it a Federal offense
to cross State or tribal lines to commit domestic violence or to violate a
protection order.[27] It is also a Federal offense to possess a firearm while
under a domestic violence protection order or if convicted of a misdemeanor
crime of domestic violence.[28] Although the vast majority of domestic violence
cases continue to be prosecuted at the State, local, and tribal levels, these
statutory tools enable Federal law enforcement to prosecute certain cases in
cooperation with the local authorities.

A Federal interstate stalking law, 18 U.S.C. ss 2261A, was enacted in 1996.
This statute prohibited individuals from traveling across a State line with the
intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of or as a result of
that travel, placing that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious
bodily injury to, that person or a member of that person's immediate family. The
statute also criminalized the same conduct within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States regardless of whether a State line was
crossed. Courts may sentence offenders to 10 years if the offense results in
serious bodily injury to the victim or if the offender uses a dangerous weapon,
20 years if permanent disfigurement or life-threatening bodily injury results, and
a life sentence if death of the victim results.

The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (VAWA 2000) amended the
Federal interstate stalking law to include travel across State and national
boundaries, as well as travel into or out of Indian country and within the special
maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.[29] VAWA 2000 also
expanded the Federal statute to cover certain travel or conduct with the intent
to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, whereas the law originally
covered only the intent to injure or harass. Moreover, it is now a violation of
Federal law to place the victim in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious
bodily injury to, the victim's current or former intimate partner. Finally, the new
statute criminalizes the use of the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign
commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places the victim in reasonable
fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, the victim, a member of the
victim's immediate family, or a spouse or intimate partner of the victim. This
new provision covers cyberstalking in which the perpetrator and the victim are
in different States or tribal jurisdictions or within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The penalties for the Federal stalking
offenses remain the same as those enacted in 1996.

Vigorous prosecution of the VAWA and VAWA-related offenses is a top
priority for the Justice Department. After passage of these laws, the
Department asked each U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) to designate a Point of
Contact for the prosecution of the Federal domestic violence and stalking laws.
In 1997, the Office for Victims of Crime funded a position of VAWA Specialist
assigned to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) to focus
exclusively on training and technical assistance for the VAWA Points of
Contact and victim witness coordinators on the prosecution of Federal
domestic violence and stalking cases. The position, originally funded for a year,
was extended for a second year. In November 1998, EOUSA created a
permanent VAWA Specialist position, in full recognition of the importance of
these cases and the continuing need for training and technical assistance.

These prosecution efforts have been successful because the USAOs have
forged partnerships with their State, local, and tribal counterparts, allowing
USAOs to bring Federal cases where appropriate. As of October 2000, the
Justice Department had prosecuted 35 cases against 39 stalkers under the
interstate stalking provision and had won convictions of 25 defendants in 23
cases (11 cases were still pending disposition as of that date).[30] In all but 1
of the 35 cases, the stalker was male. In one case, the male stalker had a
female accomplice, and in another the stalker's mother and father were his
accomplices. In 34 of the 35 cases, the victim was female, and in 27 cases the
stalker and victim were current or former intimate partners. Three cases
involved workplace stalking. As of October 2000, 18 defendants have been
sentenced and 7 are awaiting sentencing.

In the 14 sentences handed down since March 1998, the penalties have ranged
from 13 months and supervised release to life imprisonment. Defendants
pleaded guilty in 10 of these cases. In one case, in which the defendant was
sentenced to 13 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release, he
also was ordered to pay restitution and to have no contact with the victim. The
next highest sentence included an upward departure by the judge, which
resulted in 21 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release. In
another case, the defendant received a 22-month sentence and was ordered to
pay the victim $7,000, which included moving costs the victim incurred trying to
escape the stalking. Another defendant was sentenced to 60 months of
incarceration and 3 years of supervised release for interstate violation of a
protection order, interstate stalking, and arson. Other sentences included
consecutive sentences on 4 stalking counts totaling 20 years and 4 life
sentences (including 1 consecutive life sentence) for a defendant who stalked,
kidnapped, shot, and murdered the victim.

Case Examples

The following are examples of cases that have been prosecuted under the
Federal interstate stalking statute.

The USAO for the Western District of Texas prosecuted a defendant who
traveled from Alabama to Texas, where he terrorized his ex-wife and three
grown sons. The defendant, who had been in Federal custody in Alabama for
making interstate threatening phone calls to another ex-wife, traveled to Texas
after he lost custody of a minor child. At sentencing, the court considered the
defendant's lengthy history of abusing the 4 stalking victims--a history that
included beatings, torture, abandonment, threats to kill, stabbing, and burning--
and departed upward from the sentencing guidelines to impose the maximum
sentence of 20 years.

In a case prosecuted in the Eastern District of North Carolina, the defendant,
who previously had been verbally abusive toward his wife, assaulted and
threatened to kill her while she was visiting him in the State where he was
studying to receive a license to practice medicine. When she returned to their
home State, he continued to threaten her over the telephone, and he arrived at
her home one day after threatening to kill her. He was sentenced to 22 months
and was ordered to pay the victim $7,000 in restitution.

In another case, the defendant had been convicted in Nevada of assaulting his
wife and had served a 6-month sentence for the offense. After his release from
prison, he called the victim in California and threatened that he would come
after her and would destroy her car. While subject to a protection order in
Nevada, he traveled to California and set fire to his wife's car. He was
sentenced to 60 months of incarceration and 3 years of supervised release.

Another defendant, who had been abusing his wife for several years, threatened
to kill her sister, who was a police officer in a neighboring State. He also
threatened to kill a man whom he accused of being involved with his wife. The
day after he made these threats, the defendant was found approximately a
quarter mile from the home of his wife's sister, armed with a revolver and an
automatic weapon. He has been convicted of interstate stalking and awaits
sentencing.

In a case prosecuted in the District of Maine, the defendant, after losing
custody of his children, traveled to the State where his wife, from whom he was
separated, was living. An accomplice lured his wife's brother and boyfriend out
of the house, and the defendant killed them both. He and his accomplice then
kidnapped his wife and drove her to New York where they were found in a
motel room. The defendant was convicted of interstate domestic violence,
interstate stalking, kidnapping, and interstate violation of a protection order. He
received a life sentence.

Another defendant forced his wife to travel from Florida to Kentucky, where he
and an accomplice sexually assaulted her. He also harassed his wife, obtained
false arrest warrants for her, and posted signs seeking information on her
whereabouts and offering a reward for any such information. The defendant
was convicted at trial of interstate domestic violence, interstate violation of a
protection order, and interstate stalking. At sentencing, the judge departed
upward and sentenced the defendant to 87 months in prison and 3 years of
supervised release.


Conclusion

The Federal antistalking statute is a valuable tool for prosecuting cases where
the interstate nature of the offense may complicate effective State investigation
and prosecution. U.S. Attorneys can prosecute cases that they could not
pursue previously unless the case met the elements of the VAWA offenses for
crossing State or tribal lines to commit domestic violence or violation of a
protection order. 

While the interstate stalking law was not intended to supplant State and local
prosecution of stalking crimes, the Federal Government has an important role to
play in supplementing State and local efforts. In some cases, a Federal
prosecution may carry a more severe and appropriate punishment for an
offender than a prosecution under a similar State law. If a defendant has
traveled from State to State, local law enforcement officials may have difficulty
gathering evidence. Federal prosecution is not as problematic because of the
nationwide resources of the FBI. In other cases, a State prosecutor may
request that the case be referred for Federal prosecution because, once
detained by a Federal court, a defendant is more likely to remain in custody
prior to trial.

The Justice Department is committed to prosecuting cases under the VAWA
and VAWA-related statutes and to building partnerships with State, local, and
tribal counterparts. These efforts include sponsorship of and participation in
local and regional conferences addressing the dynamics of domestic violence,
prosecution of domestic violence cases, and training on the Federal domestic
violence and stalking laws. The audiences for these training conferences and
workshops have included State, local, and tribal law enforcement, prosecutors,
judges, victim advocates, and Federal law enforcement. While recognizing that
outreach extends beyond the traditional role of USAOs, the Justice Department
supports these efforts to ensure a Federal presence in interstate stalking and
domestic violence cases. Referrals of Federal cases have come from police
officers, district attorneys, shelter workers, victim advocates, and others who
come in contact with domestic violence and stalking victims. In addition, this
outreach will continue to include representatives of the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The readiness of Federal law enforcement to
respond to case referrals and to investigate and prosecute stalking cases is
critical to our efforts.

The Violence Against Women Office, EOUSA and its VAWA Specialist, and
the rest of the Justice Department will continue to support USAOs in education
and training efforts in their jurisdictions and in prosecution of cases under the
Federal domestic violence and stalking laws.

Attorney General's Report to the Vice President, U.S. Department of Justice,
August 1999.

3 Statutes that require a showing of a credible threat may be problematic in the
prosecution of stalking cases. Stalkers often do not threaten their victims overtly
or in person; rather, they engage in conduct that, when taken in context, would
cause a reasonable person to fear violence. In the context of cyberstalking, a
credible threat requirement would be even more problematic because the
stalker, sometimes unknown to the victim, may be located a great distance
away and, therefore, the threat might not be considered credible. The better
approach, codified in the Federal interstate stalking statute, 18 U.S.C. ss
2261A, is to prohibit conduct that places a person in reasonable fear of death
or bodily injury.

Stalking Victimization in a National Study of College Women." (From a
forthcoming report on sexual violence against college women funded by the
U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice).

6 The information was gathered through informal surveys of State attorneys
general, USAOs, and, to a lesser extent, local prosecutors' offices. Victim
accounts were given voluntarily through outreach conducted by the Violence
Against Women Office of the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, the
American Prosecutors Research Institute of the National District Attorneys
Association compiled a report with background information on cyberstalking,
which provided valuable information on current law enforcement efforts. 

7 These States are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. Arkansas and Maryland
have enacted statutes that cover harassment via electronic communications
outside their stalking statutes.

8 "Telecommunications device" excludes interactive computer services to
insulate the service provider from liability but not to insulate an individual user
from liability for his or her criminal behavior. Accordingly, the Justice
Department successfully argued that a modem was a telecommunications
device within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, an individual who uses a
modem to connect to the Internet and harass an individual is likely to fall within
the terms of the statute. See American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 929 F.
Supp. 824, 829 n.5 (E.D. Penn. 1996), aff'd, 521 U.S. 844 (1997);

20 This information was gathered from government Web sites, commercial
legislative reporters, and telephone interviews with selected State legislative
research bureau staff. Neal Miller of the Institute for Law and Justice
conducted the study.

21 Criminal laws involving threats include intimidation and extortion statutes,
which involve threats as punishment for past and future acts. Excluded from this
review are cases prosecuted under these related laws where the facts show
behavior totally unrelated to stalking. See, e.g., Coates v. City of Cincinnati,
402 U.S. 611 (1971) (public disturbance of the peace) and State v. Kansas,
629 P.2d 748 (Ka. Ct. App. 1981) (hate crime threats).

22 The review was primarily limited to published court decisions. However,
unpublished decisions that were available at a State court Web site were
included where relevant according to the criteria stated above.

23 The most significant omission is the exclusion of most decisions prior to
1970 on the assumption that the older cases are largely repetitive of more
recent decisions. 

24 See, e.g., Soldona v. State, 466 S.E.2d 655 (Ga. Ct. App. 1996)
(insufficient evidence claim) and People v. Garrett, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (Ct.
App. 1994) (evidence admissibility challenge). See also Kirkendoll v. State,
945 S.W.2d 400 (Ark. Ct. App. 1997) (defendant charged with stalking
claimed failure of waiver of right to counsel in pro se defense).

25 See, e.g., Robinson v. State, 615 So.2d 112 (Ala. Ct. Crim. App. 1992).
Other examples of excluded cases include People v. Thomas, 148 Cal. Rptr.
52 (Ct. App. 1978) (threat against witness testifying at future trial) and People
v. Mirmirani, 178 Cal. Rptr. 172 (1982) (political terrorism threat).

of or as a result of such conduct, committing domestic violence or violating a
protection order. 

28 See 18 U.S.C. ss 922(g)(8)-(9).

29 Violence Against Women Act of 2000 ss 1107, 18 U.S.C. ss 2261A.

30 In one case, the defendant was convicted of assault under 18 U.S.C. ss 113
but was acquitted on the interstate stalking charge. In another case, the
