ntatives, U.S. Congress has now voted
                 to increase Federal appropriations to the States to look at
                 their educational- needs and to supply the training to meet those
                 n eeds.  Further increases in the number of allied health training
                 programs should, logically, follow if local areas make their
                 needs known to the State Departments of Education.
             c.  The occupational Training Programs, Manpower Development and
                 Training Act is co-administered by the Department of Labor and
                 HEW and emphasizes training programs for the unemployed and
                 underemployed.  State plans should provide for 2/3 of NDTA basic
                 program enrollees to be disadvantaged individuals.
                 During fiscal year 1970, the Manpower Administration will encourage
                 programs that include training for new occupations to relieve more
                 highly skilled personnel of routine duties, upgrading existing
                 personnel such as nurses aides to LP@ls, training in connection with
                 development of career ladders and training which may assist in
                 reducing turnover.
             d.  There now exists throughout the country Cooperative Area Manpower
                 Planning Systems Committees in each area.  CAMS is an interagency
                 effort with representatives from the Departments of Labor; Health,
                 Education, and Welfare; Office of Economic Opportunity; Agriculture;
                 Commerce; Housing and Urban Development; Interior and Civil Service
                 Commission to identify manpower problems in an area, delineate
                 resources and develop linkages between pro@rams.
