iology. This is a
> fabulous review of soil C sequestration under different land-uses. However,
> I am pulling my hair out trying to work out why my calculations taken from
> Brown and Lugo (1990) differ from those in Table 1, Post and Kwon (2000).
> Taking  the subtropical wet forest, 10yr old crop fields to mahogany
> plantation, as an example (Table 1, Post and Kwon 2000), I calculated the
> change in C content (i.e. difference between CA2 and LF6) to 50 cm depth as
> 4.5 kg C/m2 (Fig 4a, Brown and Lugo 1990). I then multiplied this by 1000
> (to get g C/m2) and divided by the age of the forest (51 years, Table 1,
> Brown and Lugo 1990) to come up with a rate of C change of 88 g C/m2/y. But
> you have 310 g C/m2/y. Do you know what I am doing wrong?

> Also, have you come across any other studies which have shown rates of soil
> C change under afforestation since Post and Kwon (2000) was published?

> Hope you can help.
