data transmitter system.

There are several sections of the planetary surface which have not yet
been mapped and JPL Magellan controllers are fine tuning procedures
which will be used later this summer to ensure that data of those
regions are transmitted with the least likelihood of noise or other
problems corrupting the data.  In the meantime, Magellan's orbital
housekeeping functions such as star calibrations and gyro despinning
continue nominally.

Here's the broadcast schedule for Public Affairs events on NASA Select
TV.  Note that all events and times may change without notice, and that
all times listed are Eastern.  Live indicates a program is transmitted
live.
