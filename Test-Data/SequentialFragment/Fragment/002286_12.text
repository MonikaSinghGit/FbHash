 the
particular  type  of equipment, rather than the manufacturing  or
wholesale distribution of that equipment.  SIC Appeals  of  Trico
Rentals,  Inc.,  No. 3619 (1992); Gell Service Industries,  Inc.,
No.  3456  (1991);  and Associate Administrator  for  Procurement
Assistance, No. 1431 (1981) [2].

     Exceptions  to  this  rule are based  on  the  SIC  Manual's
description of the 7359 code, which classifies certain  types  of
equipment rental under other SIC codes.  SIC Manual, p. 364.  One
such exception covers procurements for equipment manufactured  by
the  firms  which  lease or sell their own  products,  where  the
statement  of  work requires the contractor to provide  extensive
maintenance  and servicing for the equipment.  These procurements
are  classified under the manufacturing SIC code appropriate  for
that  equipment.   SIC  Appeal  of  Mobile  Steam  Boiler  Rental
Corporation, No. 4208 (1996).

      Here, however, the exception does not apply.  INS does  not
intend to purchase the desired equipment from a manufacturer but,
rather,  to lease it:  the solicitation does not require  INS  to
lease  it  from  a manufacturer of the equipment.   Nor  does  it
require  the  contractor  to  provide  services,  beyond  routine
maintenance.  The facts here, therefore, are closer to the  facts
in  the  Trico Rentals, Inc., supra, line of cases than to Mobile
Steam Boiler, supra.

     Further,   SIC   code  7359  explicitly  covers   electronic
equipment  leasing,  while  SIC  code  5063  covers  wholesalers.
Accordingly, because INS wishes to rent electronic equipment, not
to  purchase it; the solicitation does not specify the rental  be
from  a  manufacturer  of the equipment,  and  does  not  require
extensive servicing, Appellant has met its burden of establishing
clear  error  in  the CO's SIC code designation.  Therefore,  the
appropriate SIC code for the procurement is 7359.


                         III. CONCLUSION

     The  Administrative Judge REVERSES the CO's  designation  of
SIC   code  5063,  Electrical  Apparatus  and  Equipment,  Wiring
Supplies, and Construction Materials, for this procurement.   The
Administrative Judge concludes instead the appropriate  SIC  code
is 7359, Equipment Rental and Leasing, Not Elsewhere Classified.
     
     This  is the Small Business Administration's final decision.
