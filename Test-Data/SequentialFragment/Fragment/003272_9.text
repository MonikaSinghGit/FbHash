 the juror conference, there remains the questionwhether their failure to assert that right constituted a waiver.  Thecourt of appeals' answer to that question conflicts with decisions ofthis Court and other courts of appeals and with the terms of Rule 43.   The court of appeals held (App., infra, 11a) that the standard forwaiver of the right to be present is that enunciated in Johnson v.Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938) ("intentional relinquishment orabandonment of a known right or privilege").  Since there was noevidence in the record directly establishing that respondents had madea conscious, informed decision to absent themselves from the jurorconference, the court of appeals could not "conclude that theyknowingly and intelligently waived their constitutional right to bepresent" (App., infra, 11a).   We note initially that this analysis depends for its validity onthe premise, shown to be erroneous in the preceding discussion, thatany right the respondents had to attend the conference wasconstitutionally based.  But even were that premise correct, the wrongwaiver standard was employed by the court of appeals.  Indeed, itsholding is in direct conflict with Taylor v. United States, 414 U.S.17, 19-20 (1973).  There, the Court held that the Johnson v. Zerbststandard is inapplicable to a defendant's waiver of the right to bepresent at trial, even for portions as critical as the taking ofevidence.  The voluntary absence of the defendant from the proceeding,without more, constitutes a valid waiver.   There are sound reasons not to apply the Johnson v. Zerbst standardin situations of this kind.  The benefit of some rights (the right tobe present among them) may be realized as well by waiving them as byasserting them.  The question before Gagnon and his attorney was notwhether Gagnon should "relinquish" or "abandon" a valuableconstitutional right, but whether it was more in Gagnon's interest tobe absent from or present at the juror interview.  "Under ouradversary system, once a defendant has the assistance of counsel thevast array of trial decisions, strategic and tactical, * * * restswith the accused and his attorney." Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501,512 (1976).   Estelle v. Williams presents a close analogy to this case.  There,the Court considered whether a criminal defendant who does not ask towear civilian clothes is denied due process of law by trial in prisongarb.  Observing that "it is not an uncommon defense tactic to producethe defendant in jail clothes in the hope of eliciting sympathy fromthe jury" (425 U.S. at 508), the Court held that a defendant isrequired to object to being tried in jail garments (ibid.).  The Courtexpressly rejected the notion that a "strategic and tactical" decisionof this sort, made by a defendant advised by competent counsel, is tobe measured against the Johnson v. Zerbst standard for intentionalrelinquishment of a constitutional right.  425 U.S. at 508 n.3.Accordingly, the Court reasoned, the trial judge is not required to"ask() the (defendant) or his counsel whether he was deliberatelygoing to trial in jail clothes." The failure to make an objection, forwhatever reason, is "sufficient to negate the presence of compulsionnecessary to establish a constitutional violation." Id. at 512-513.   The answer here follows a fortiori from Estelle.  No less clearly"strategic and tactical" than the decision to stand trial in prisongarb is the defendant's decision not to attend a juror conference.See Polizzi v. United States, 550 F.2d at 1137.  As noted at pages13-14, supra, there are persuasive (often compelling) reasons why acriminal defendant would prefer to be absent rather than to chill thejuror's willingness to answer candidly.  A defendant's failure toinvoke the right to attend, or to object to the proceeding, istherefore sufficient to establish that his absence was voluntary./19/   The analysis is unchanged when the focus shifts to Rule 43.  Rule43(a) provides that "(t)he defendant shall be present at * * * everystage of the trial * * * except as otherwise provided by this rule."Rule 43(b) provides that "the defendant shall be considered to havewaived his right to be present whenever a defendant, initiallypresent, (1) voluntarily absents himself after the trial has commenced* * * ." Here, respondents plainly waived their right to be presentwhen they did not attend, and made no request to attend, the jurorinterview.   The court of appeals rejected the government's argument thatrespondents had waived their Rule 43 right to be present, on theground that there was no indication in the record "of whether Gagnonor the other defendants expressly or impliedly indicated theirwillingness to be absent from the conference" (App., infra, 10a)./20/ On this issue, the court declared it irrelevant that none of thedefendants asked to attend.  /21/ The holding below is thus contraryto the plain language of Rule 43 and to decisions of this Court.   By its terms, Rule 43(b) provides that a defendant "shall beconsidered to have waived his right to be present" (emphasis added) ifhe "voluntarily absents himself after the trial has commenced." Deedsare all;  there is no additional requirement that the defendantexpress or imply anything about his "willingness to be absent." Nor isthe trial court required to address specific inquiries to thedefendant to ensure that he was aware of, and voluntarily waiving, hisright.  On these matters, as with the vast majority of questions thatarise during trial, our system relies on counsel to assert thedefendant's rights where appropriate.  /22/   Accordingly, most courts of appeals to consider the issue haveconcluded that a defendant waives his right to attend a conference atthe bench or in chambers if he does not object or request to attend.See, e.g., United States v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 497 (D.C. Cir.1983);  United States v. Provenzano, 620 F.2d 985, 998 (3d Cir.),cert. denied, 449 U.S. 899 (1980);  United States v. Bufalino, 576F.2d 446, 451 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 928 (1978);  UnitedStates v. Brown, 571 F.2d 980, 987 (6th Cir. 1978).  This conflictamong the circuits should be resolved.   2. Not only did respondents make no attempt to attend the jurorinterview;  they also made no objection to the proceeding when itoccurred or at any point during the trial.  Accordingly, even assumingthat respondents' rights under Rule 43 of the Constitution were infact violated under the circumstances of this case, the court ofappeals was not justified in reversing on that basis.  /23/ UnitedStates v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163 & nn.13-14 (1982);  Estelle v.Williams, 425 U.S. at 508-509 & n.3;  see Br. for the United States at26-35, in United States v. Young, No. 83-469 (argued Oct. 2, 1984)./24/ Cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 30.   The court below held, however, that the error could be noticedunder the "plain error" exception of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) eventhough it had not been brought to the attention of the trial court.But the court did not make the finding of substantial prejudice, or"miscarriage of justice," necessary to justify reversal under Rule52(b).  See Frady, 456 U.S. at 163 & nn.13-14.  The court of appealsheld that "(a) criminal defendant's right to be present at every stageof his trial is so fundamental that, in certain circumstances, itsviolation must be noticed by a reviewing court regardless of a failureto raise the issue below" (App., infra, 11a n.2).  By this, the courtapparently meant that the right to be present is so fundamental thatin all circumstances its violation must be noticed by the appellatecourt.  /25/ That holding is plainly wrong, and is in direct conflictwith Rushen v. Spain, supra, Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35(1975), and numerous decisions by other courts of appeals.  /26/   In Rushen, this Court "emphatically" held (slip op. 3), incircumstances far more troubling than these, that an infringement onthe right to be present during communications between judge and jurormay have so little impact on the fairness of the trial that it isharmless error.  /27/ Put differently, a court of appeals may notpresume, on the basis of the nature of the right, that the error hadsufficient impact to justify reversal of a conviction.  Slip op. 3.It follows, a fortiori, that an infringement on the right to bepresent cannot be presumed to violate the "substantial rights of theaccused" or to be a "miscarriage of justice" -- standardssignificantly more exacting than the harmless error standard.   The court of appeal's abjuration of the "substantial prejudice"analysis under Rule 52(b) also conflicts with Rogers v. United States,supra.  There, the Court concluded that a reviewing court could noticean error that included a denial of the right to be present duringcommunications between judge and jury, in the absence of a timelyobjection, where the error was "fraught with potential prejudice" (422U.S. at 41).  /28/ In the absence of a finding of substantialprejudice -- or so Rogers would indicate -- there would be no basisfor reaching the issue.   It is difficult to see how the court of appeals could haveconcluded that there was a miscarriage of justice here, had it engagedin an appropriate "plain error" analysis.  As noted, the presence ofrespondents at the juror interview would have been useless or worsethan useless.  The court of appeals' own suggestion as to prejudice,as has been shown, was fanciful.  And finally, the underlying issue --the impartiality of the jurors who observed respondent Gagnonsketching -- was resolved by the trial court, on the basis of aninterview with the principal juror in question.  The question of jurorimpartiality is heavily dependent on the trial court's assessment ofthe sincerity of the juror's answers.  There is nothing in the recordthat would justify an appellate court in overturning the trial court'sconclusion that the jury panel would not be tainted by the sketchingincident.  See Rushen v. Spain, slip op. 6.  This is especially truesince defense counsel expressly agreed with the trial court's decisionat trial.   Many courts of appeals, in factual circumstances similar to orworse than these, have concluded that there was no prejudice to thedefendant from a denial of his right to be present at every stage oftrial.  The reasoning, as well as the result, of these decisions is indirect conflict with the decision below.  /29/ See, e.g., UnitedStates v. Brown, 571 F.2d 980, 987 (6th Cir. 1978) (defendant'sabsence from conference in chambers regarding dismissal of juror wasnot prejudicial given defense counsel's presence and the availabilityof a transcript of the proceeding;  furthermore, the issue was waivedby failure to object);  Henderson v. Lane, 613 F.2d 175, 179 (7thCir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 986 (1980) (defendant's absence fromexamination of alternate jurors was harmless because counsel waspresent, proceeding was on the record, and defendant had been presentduring original jury selection);  United States v. Washington, 705F.2d 489, 498 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (defendant's absence from colloquy atbench with potential jurors was harmless because counsel was presentand took notes);  Nevels v. Parratt, 596 F.2d 344 (8th Cir. 1979)(defendant's absence from conference with juror concerning possiblemisconduct was harmless;  defense counsel participated in conference,no request for defendant to attend was made, and State had shown thatjuror in question remained impartial);  /30/ see also United States v.Walls, 577 F.2d 690, 697-699 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 893(1978) (defendant's absence from conference with juror harmlessbecause counsel was present, the conference was on record, and noobjection was raised).  The decision below conflicts even morestrikingly with decisions finding the absence of the defendant from astage of the proceeding harmless even though defense counsel was notpresent.  E.g., United States v. Yonn, 702 F.2d 1341, 1344-1345 (11thCir. 1983);  United States v. Dominguez, 615 F.2d 1093, 1094-1096 (5thCir. 1980);  United States v. Bufalino, 576 F.2d 446, 451 (2d Cir.),cert. denied, 439 U.S. 928 (1978).   The conclusion is inescapable that the convictions in this case forserious crimes involving hundreds of thousands of dollars in wholesalenarcotics trafficking were needlessly reversed.  Moreover, it isapparent that many future convictions could suffer the same fate underthe court of appeals' tortured understanding of the right to bepresent at trial and the defendant's lack of any obligation to assertthat right at a time when it could be accommodated.  This Courtrecently summarily reversed a Ninth Circuit decision that opened thegate to reversals on the basis of the right to be present, withoutregard to whether the supposed violations were prejudicial to thedefense.  Rushen v. Spain, supra.  The instant decision, from the samecourt of appeals, is in a similar vein, but with potentially morefar-reaching consequences.  /31/   It was in precisely the same context of a supposed infringement onthe right to be present that this Court stated in Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U.S. at 122:      There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into      contempt -- that discredit will even touch the great immunities      assured by the Fourteenth Amendment -- if gossamer possibilities      of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence pronounced      by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience to * * * law,      and set the guilty free.                              CONCLUSION   The petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted.   Respectfully submitted.   Rex E. Lee      Solicitor General   Stephen S. Trott      Assistant Attorney General   Andrew L. Frey      Deputy Solicitor General   Michael W. McConnell      Assistant to the Solicitor General   Gloria C. Phares      Attorney   October 1984   /1/ Of the eight possession counts with which they were variouslycharged, respondents were convicted as follows:  Gagnon on one count(Count 3);  Valenzuela on one count (Count 13);  Storms on sevencounts (Counts 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, and 13);  and Martin on two counts(Counts 2 and 3).   /2/ Nine others were indicted with respondents.  Alvaro Becerra,Timothy Pohlschneider, Gentry Neal, and John Cates pleaded guilty.The charges against Kevin Hynes, David Linquist, and Keith Mors weredismissed on the government's motion, and Hynes and Linquist testifiedfor the government at trial.  Donald Tore Jensen and Wes Lundy arefugitives.  [John Doe] pleaded guilty to a separate indictmentand testified for the government at trial.   /3/ One kilo equals 2.2 pounds.   /4/ Respondent Gagnon, who claimed an alibi, was the only defendantto testify at trial.  Although he denied any narcotics transactionswith [John Doe], he admitted that he owned a type of microscope(stereoscope) and that he had introduced [John Doe] to Jensen (Tr. 709,714).   /5/ These events in October 1979 form the basis for Count 2.   /6/ "CR" refers to the district court clerk's record of exhibits.   /7/ These events form the basis for the charge against respondentMartin in Count 3 and respondent Storms in Count 4.   /8/ These events form the basis for Count 5.   /9/ The May 29 transaction formed the basis for Count 8, and theMay 30 transaction formed the basis for Count 11.   /10/ This transaction formed the basis for Count 12.   /11/ This transaction formed the basis for Count 13.   /12/ None of the other defendants expressed concern over theincident.   /13/ At oral argument in the court of appeals, Gagnon's attorneystated that he had been invited to the conference through a note fromthe judge delivered by the bailiff.  App., infra, 10a n.1.   /14/ See, e.g., Rushen v. Spain, No. 82-2083 (Dec. 12 1983);Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35 (1975);  United States v.Betancourt, 734 F.2d 750 (11th Cir. 1984);  United States v.Silverstein, 732 F.2d 1338 (7th Cir. 1984), petitions for cert.pending, Nos. 84-5492 and 84-5500;  United States v. Head, 697 F.2d1200 (4th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, No. 82-1655 (June 20, 1983);United States v. Ronder, 639 F.2d 931 (2d Cir. 1981);  Henderson v.Lane, 613 F.2d 175 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 986 (1980);Nevels v. Parratt, 596 F.2d 344 (8th Cir. 1979).   /15/ Interestingly, much of the activity undertaken by counsel andthe jurors in the absence of the defendants in Snyder consisted ofevaluating distances and angles at the scene of the crime.  291 U.S.at 103-104.  It apparently did not occur to this Court that suchcalculations might be better performed by the defendants personally.   /16/ The court of appeals suggested (App., infra, 8a) that theprejudice against Gagnon "may be extended to the (other defendants),"in light of the vicarious liability of co-conspirators.  However, inthis prosecution, each of the defendants was charged and convictedonly in connection with criminal activity in which the governmentproved he took a direct part.  See pages 3-5, supra.  There was noPinkerton charge.   /17/ LaChappelle is a compelling illustration of this point.There, the trial judge held a private discussion, on the record, witha 16-year-old complaining witness in a rape prosecution against herfather, concerning her embarrassment over describing her father'ssexual climax during the incident.  In open court, the witness hadbeen so embarrassed that she refused to answer defense counsel'squestions.  The defendant requested to be present at the conference,but his request was denied and his objection overruled.  AlthoughLaChappelle arose on habeas corpus review of a state court conviction,and the constitutional standard thus applied, it is difficult tobelieve that Rule 43 would have required the witness's father to bepermitted to attend had the prosecution been in federal court.  Seealso United States v. Howell, 514 F.2d 710, 714 (5th Cir.), cert.denied, 423 U.S. 914 (1975) (defendant properly excluded frominterview with juror who had been offered a bribe, and from subsequentdiscussion with counsel);  United States v. Ruiz-Estrella, 481 F.2d723 (2d Cir. 1973) (defendant properly excluded from portion ofsuppression hearing dealing with secret profile).   /18/ The pertinent difference between Rule 43 and theconstitutional right to be present at conferences between judge andjuror is that the defendant may invoke the latter only when hispresence would be useful to his defense, while the former creates astrong presumption in favor of the defendant's presence.  Neither Rule43 nor the Constitution guarantees the defendant's right to be presentwhere other legitimate interests would be infringed.  The court ofappeals failed to recognize any limits on the Rule 43 rightwhatsoever, and thus erroneously reversed these convictions and set adamaging precedent for future cases.   /19/ As in Estelle, 425 U.S. at 512 n.9, it is irrelevant whetherthe decision not to attend the conference was "a defense tactic orsimply indifference.  In either case, respondent's silence precludesany suggestion of compulsion."   /20/ The court of appeals apparently thought that this standard isless "stringent" than the Johnson v. Zerbst standard it applied to theconstitutional right to be present at trial.  App., infra, 11a.However, as this Court observed in Estelle, 425 U.S. at 512, torequire the trial court to make inquiries regarding the voluntarinessof an act would be equivalent to imposing the Johnson v. Zerbststandard.  In any event, this Court has applied the same analysis towaiver of the right to be present at trial under both Rule 43 and theConstitution, without distinction.  Failure by a criminal defendant,represented by competent counsel, to invoke his right to be present ata conference between judge and juror constitutes a valid waiver.   /21/ The court stated that respondents' failure to object wasrelevant to the question of prejudice, but not to the question ofvoluntary absence, or waiver.  App., infra, 10a-11a.   /22/ The advisory committee notes to Rule 43 confirm this analysis. The notes state that "voluntary absence may constitute a waiver evenif the defendant has not been informed by the court of his (right) toremain during the trial."   /23/ It seems clear that the contemporaneous objection requirementapplies to a supposed infringement of the right to be present attrial.  Had the error been called to the attention of the trial judgebefore the end of trial, he could have cured any possible prejudice bysubstituting the alternate jurors for the two jurors who observedrespondent Gagnon sketching.  The obligation to afford the trial courtan opportunity to remedy an error at trial is the principal basis forthe contemporaneous objection requirement.  Estelle v. Williams, 425U.S. at 508 n.3.   But even assuming defendants were under no obligation to object inorder to preserve this issue for appeal, no reversible error resultedfrom the juror interview.  A denial of the right to be present attrial does not warrant reversal of a conviction unless it resulted inprejudice to the defense.  Rushen v. Spain, supra.  We believe thatthe court of appeals was cearly incorrect in its conclusion (App.,infra, 13a-14a) that respondents' absence from the juror interview wasnot harmless error.  Indeed, we believe their absence enhanced theirability to secure a fair trial before an impartial jury.  See pages13-14, supra.  In this connection, we would note that the court'sapplication (App., infra, 13a) of the constitutional harmless errorstandard to what we have shown above was at most a violation of Rule43 (see pages 16-17, supra) was in error.   /24/ Copies of our brief in Young have been provided to counsel forrespondents.   /25/ We can agree that, "in certain circumstances" (App., infra,11a n.2), the denial of the right to be present might well be sofundamental an error that it should be noticed by an appellate courteven in the absence of a timely objection.  See, e.g., Rogers v.United States, 422 U.S. 35, 41 (1975).  However, the court of appealsdid not, as its statement of the law would suggest, inquire whether infact there were any circumstances here (i.e., substantial prejudice tothe defense) that would warrant a finding of plain error.  Wetherefore interpret the court as holding that no finding ofsubstantial prejudice is required.   /26/ For an error to be "plain," it must be both obvious andsubstantially prejudicial.  Although the focus of the discussion tofollow is on the court of appeals' failure to make a finding ofsubstantial prejudice, we would also point out that the error (if itwas error) was far from obvious.  Indeed, our position is that it wasnot error at all.  See pages 12-22, supra.  Even if this Courtdisagrees, we would submit that the question of the correctness of thetrial court's actions is, at worst, a close one.   /27/ Both this case and Rushen involve conferences between thetrial judge and a juror without the defendant being present.  InRushen, however, no defense counsel was present;  indeed, thedefendants did not even find out about the conference until aftertrial (slip op. 2).  Here, by contrast, the conference was announcedin open court and attended by defense counsel.  Further, in Rushen, notranscript was made of the conference;  the defendants or a reviewingcourt therefore had no reliable means of knowing what transpired.Here, a transcript was prepared and available to all parties.  If theerror in Rushen could be held to be harmless, the error here, if any,could hardly be plain error.   Rushen was decided by this Court four days after the court ofappeals rendered the judgment below, but it was forcefully called tothe court's attention by the government's unsuccessful petition forrehearing.   /28/ In Rogers, the trial court, without notifying the defendant ordefense counsel, made a misleading written response to a query fromthe jury.  The possibility that the error affected the jury's verdictwas substantial.   /29/ Although the analysis of prejudice in the decisions discussedin text is sometimes under the rubric of "harmless error" rather than"plain error," that fact does not detract from the conflict in thecircuits.  If an error is so nonprejudicial that it is harmless, itobviously falls short of the stringent "miscarriage of justice"standard for finding plain error.  See United States v. Silverstein,732 F.2d at 1349.   /30/ On the issue of prejudice, the decision below also conflictswith United States v. Silverstein, 732 F.2d at 1348-1349 (defendant'sabsence from courtroom while the trial court formulated a response toa query from the jury not reversible error because defense counsel waspresent, no objection was made, and the outcome of the trial was notlikely affected).  Silverstein differs from the instant case in thatthe proceeding from which the defendants were absent was a conferencebetween trial court and counsel on an issue of law.  Such conferencesare expressly permitted to be held in the absence of the defendantunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(3), and the convictions in Silversteincould have been affirmed on that ground.   /31/ In Rushen, the only issue was whether an assumed violation ofthe right to be present at trial was subject to a "harmless error"analysis.  Here, the question is whether criminal defendants will bepermitted to remain silent at trial, and then obtain reversal ofconvictions on the basis of insubstantial claims of prejudice.  Thedisruptive effect of the decision below could be significant.   APPENDIX
